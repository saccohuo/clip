Wallace hits on our need to manage rather than remove our core hard-wired human instincts.  

华莱士一针见血地指出，我们需要管理而不是消除人类的内核本能。

Here are the links to the original audio followed by the entire speech.  

以下是原始音频链接和演讲全文链接。

“Greetings parents and congratulations to Kenyon’s graduating class of 2005. There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”  

"家长们好，祝贺凯尼恩大学 2005 届毕业生。有两条年轻的鱼在游泳，碰巧遇到一条年长的鱼从另一个方向游来，年长的鱼向他们点点头说："早上好，孩子们。水怎么样？"两条小鱼游了一会儿 最后其中一条看着另一条说 "水是什么鬼东西？"

This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you’re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don’t be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.  

这是美国开学典礼演讲的标准要求，即部署说教式的小寓言故事。但如果你们担心我打算在这里以睿智的老鱼身份向你们这些小鱼解释什么是水，请不要担心。我不是那条聪明的老鱼。鱼的故事只是想说，最明显、最重要的现实往往是最难看到和谈论的现实。当然，作为一个英语句子，这只是一个平庸的陈词滥调，但事实上，在成年人的日常生存中，平庸的陈词滥调可能具有生死攸关的重要意义，或者说，在这个干燥而可爱的早晨，我想向你们提出这样的建议。

Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I’m supposed to talk about your liberal arts education’s meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let’s talk about the single most pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about “teaching you how to think.” If you’re like me as a student, you’ve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I’m going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we’re supposed to get in a place like this isn’t really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I’d ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your scepticism about the value of the totally obvious.  

当然，这类演讲的主要要求是，我应该谈谈你们接受文科教育的意义，试图解释为什么你们即将获得的学位具有实际的人文价值，而不仅仅是物质回报。因此，让我们来谈谈毕业典礼致辞中最普遍的陈词滥调，即文科教育与其说是让你掌握知识，不如说是 "教你如何思考"。如果你像我一样是个学生，你就不会喜欢听到这样的话，你会觉得 "你需要别人教你如何思考 "的说法有点侮辱你，因为你能被这么好的大学录取，似乎就证明你已经知道如何思考了。但我想告诉你的是，文科的陈词滥调其实一点也不侮辱人，因为在这样的地方，我们应该得到的真正重要的思维教育，其实并不在于思考的能力，而在于选择思考的内容。如果你对思考内容的完全自由选择似乎过于明显而不值得浪费时间讨论，那么我想请你思考一下鱼和水的问题，并对完全明显的事物的价值持怀疑态度，只需几分钟即可。

Here’s another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: “Look, it’s not like I don’t have actual reasons for not believing in God. It’s not like I haven’t ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn’t see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out ‘Oh, God, if there is a God, I’m lost in this blizzard, and I’m gonna die if you don’t help me.’” And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. “Well then you must believe now,” he says, “After all, here you are, alive.” The atheist just rolls his eyes. “No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.”  

这里还有一个说教式的小故事。在阿拉斯加偏远荒野的一家酒吧里，有两个人坐在一起。其中一个人信教，另一个人是无神论者，两个人在争论上帝的存在，争论的特别激烈，大约是在喝了第四瓶啤酒之后。无神论者说："听着，我并不是没有理由不相信上帝。我也不是没有尝试过上帝和祈祷这件事。就在上个月，我离开营地时遇到了可怕的暴风雪，我完全迷失了方向，什么也看不见，当时的气温是零下 50 度，于是我就试了一下：我跪倒在雪地里 哭喊着'上帝啊 如果真有上帝的话 我在暴风雪中迷路了 如果你不救我 我就要死了'"现在，在酒吧里，那个信教的人不解地看着那个无神论者。"那你现在一定相信了，"他说，"毕竟，你还活着。"无神论者只是翻了翻白眼。"不，伙计，那只是几个爱斯基摩人碰巧路过 给我指了回营地的路"

It’s easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people’s two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy’s interpretation is true and the other guy’s is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person’s most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there’s the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They’re probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists’ problem is exactly the same as the story’s unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn’t even know he’s locked up.  

用标准的文科分析法来分析这个故事很容易：完全相同的经历对两个不同的人可能意味着两种完全不同的东西，因为这些人有两种不同的信仰模板和两种不同的从经验中建构意义的方法。因为我们崇尚宽容和信仰的多样性，所以在我们的文科分析中，没有任何地方我们想要宣称一个人的解释是正确的，而另一个人的解释是错误的或糟糕的。这很好，但我们也从未讨论过这些个人模板和信仰的来源。也就是说，它们来自这两个人的内心。就好像一个人对世界最基本的取向，以及他的经验的意义，在某种程度上只是硬连接的，就像身高或鞋码一样；或者是自动从文化中吸收的，就像语言一样。就好像我们如何构建意义实际上并不是一个个人有意选择的问题。此外，还有整个傲慢问题。这个没有宗教信仰的家伙如此笃定地否定了路过的爱斯基摩人与他的求救祷告有关的可能性。的确，有很多宗教人士看起来也很傲慢，对自己的解释也很肯定。至少对我们大多数人来说，他们可能比无神论者更令人厌恶。但是，宗教教条主义者的问题与故事中的无神论者如出一辙：盲目的确定性，一种闭塞的思想，这种思想等同于一种禁锢，禁锢得如此彻底，以至于囚犯甚至不知道自己被关了起来。

The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.  

这里的重点是，我认为这就是教我如何思考的真正含义之一。让自己不那么傲慢。对我自己和我的确定性有一点批判意识。因为事实证明，我自动肯定的东西中，有很大一部分是完全错误和自欺欺人的。这是我的惨痛教训，我预言你们毕业生也会如此。

Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre of the universe; the realest, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it’s so socially repulsive. But it’s pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute centre of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people’s thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.  

这里有一个例子可以说明我自动确信的事情是完全错误的：我眼前的一切都支持我的深刻信念，即我是宇宙的绝对中心；是存在的最真实、最生动、最重要的人。我们很少思考这种自然的、基本的自我中心，因为它在社会上是如此令人厌恶。但我们每个人都一样。它是我们的默认设置，一出生就硬性植入了我们的大脑。想想看：你所经历过的一切，没有一个不是以你为绝对中心的。你所经历的世界就在你的面前或身后，在你的左边或右边，在你的电视或显示器上。诸如此类。别人的想法和感受必须以某种方式传达给你，但你自己的想法和感受却是如此直接、迫切和真实。

Please don’t worry that I’m getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It’s a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being “well-adjusted”, which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.  

请不要担心，我正准备给你们上一堂关于同情心、他人导向或所有所谓美德的课。这不是美德的问题。这是我选择做的一件事，以某种方式改变或摆脱我与生俱来的、硬连线的默认设置，那就是深深地、实实在在地以自我为中心，并通过这个自我透镜来看待和解释一切。能够以这种方式调整其自然默认设置的人通常被称为 "适应良好 "的人，我想这并不是一个偶然的说法。

Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education–least in my own case–is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualise stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.  

鉴于这里的学术氛围十分浓厚，一个显而易见的问题是，在调整我们的默认设置的工作中，有多少涉及到实际知识或智力。这个问题变得非常棘手。学术教育最危险的地方--至少就我自己而言--可能就是它让我倾向于过度知识化，迷失在头脑中抽象的争论中，而不是简单地关注眼前发生的事情，关注我内心发生的事情。

As I’m sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotised by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about “the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.”  

我相信你们现在都知道，要保持警觉、全神贯注，而不是被自己脑子里不断的独白催眠是一件非常困难的事情（可能现在就正在发生）。在我毕业二十年后，我逐渐明白，文科教育中 "教你如何思考 "的陈词滥调实际上是一个更深刻、更严肃的概念的缩写：学会思考实际上意味着学会如何对自己思考的方式和内容进行一定的控制。这意味着要有足够的意识和觉知，来选择你关注的内容，选择你如何从经验中构建意义。因为如果你不能在成人生活中行使这种选择权，你就会彻底完蛋。想想 "思想是一个出色的仆人，但却是一个可怕的主人 "这句老生常谈吧。

This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.  

这就像许多陈词滥调一样，表面上蹩脚无趣，实际上却表达了一个伟大而可怕的事实。用枪支自杀的成年人几乎总是向自己的头部开枪，这丝毫不是巧合。他们向可怕的主人开枪。而事实是，大多数自杀者在扣动扳机之前其实早已死去。

And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let’s get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what “day in day out” really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I’m talking about.  

我认为，这才是文科教育的真正价值所在：如何在舒适、富足、受人尊敬的成年生活中，不至于死气沉沉、失去知觉，成为头脑和自然默认设置的奴隶，日复一日地独来独往、完全孤独。这听起来像是夸张，或是抽象的废话。让我们具体分析一下。事实上，你们这些即将毕业的高年级学生还不知道 "日复一日 "的真正含义。在美国成年人的生活中，恰好有很大一部分是没有人在毕业典礼演讲中提及的。其中之一就是无聊、例行公事和小挫折。在座的父母和长辈们一定非常清楚我在说什么。

By way of example, let’s say it’s an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day you’re tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all again. But then you remember there’s no food at home. You haven’t had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. It’s the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it’s the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and it’s pretty much the last place you want to be but you can’t just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store’s confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to manoeuvre your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren’t enough check-out lanes open even though it’s the end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating. But you can’t take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college.  

举个例子，假设这是成年人的普通一天，你早上起床，去做你那份具有挑战性的、白领阶层的、大学毕业生的工作，你辛辛苦苦地工作了八、十个小时，一天结束的时候，你很疲惫，有些压力，你只想回家吃一顿丰盛的晚餐，或许放松一个小时，然后早早地上床睡觉，因为第二天你当然还得起床，再做一遍。但你会想起家里没有食物。因为你的工作很有挑战性，这周你都没时间去买东西，所以现在下班后你必须坐上车，开车去超市。现在是下班时间，交通状况可能会：非常糟糕。当你终于到达超市时，超市里人山人海，当然，这时候其他有工作的人也在挤时间买东西。店里的灯光很刺眼，还充斥着令人销魂的嗡嗡声或公司的流行音乐，这是你最不想去的地方，但你又不能就这样进去然后很快出来；你必须在灯火通明的偌大商店混乱的过道里四处游荡，才能找到你想要的东西，你还必须推着你的垃圾购物车，穿过所有其他疲惫不堪、匆匆忙忙推着购物车的人（诸如此类，诸如此类，因为这是一个漫长的仪式，所以要把东西剪掉），最终你才能买到所有的晚餐用品，但现在发现，尽管是下班高峰期，结账信道却不够用。因此，结账的队伍长得令人难以置信，这既愚蠢又令人恼火。 但你不能把你的挫败感发泄到疯狂的收银员身上，她的工作已经过度劳累，每天的乏味和无意义超出了我们这些名牌大学学生的想象。

But anyway, you finally get to the checkout line’s front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to “Have a nice day” in a voice that is the absolute voice of death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera.  

但无论如何，你终于排到了收银台的前面，付了钱，别人用一种绝对是死亡的声音对你说 "祝你今天过得愉快"。然后，你不得不把你那令人毛骨悚然的、薄薄的、塑料袋装的杂货放在推车里，推车有一个疯狂的轮子，令人抓狂地向左拉，一路穿过拥挤、颠簸、车水马龙的停车场，然后你不得不一路开回家，穿过缓慢、沉重、SUV密集、高峰时段的交通，等等等等。

Everyone here has done this, of course. But it hasn’t yet been part of you graduates’ actual life routine, day after week after month after year.  

当然，这里的每个人都这样做过。但这还没有成为你们这些毕业生日复一日、周复一日、月复一月、年复一年的实际生活习惯的一部分。

But it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point. The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don’t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I’m gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop. Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it’s going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.  

但终将如此。除此之外，还有许多沉闷、恼人、看似毫无意义的例行公事。但这不是重点。问题的关键在于，像这样琐碎、令人沮丧的垃圾正是选择工作要做的地方。因为拥堵的交通、拥挤的过道、冗长的结账队伍给了我思考的时间，而如果我不有意识地决定如何思考和关注什么，那么每次购物我都会感到愤怒和痛苦。因为我天生的默认设置就是，这种情况其实都是为了我自己。我饥肠辘辘，我疲惫不堪，我只想快点回家，而其他人好像都在挡我的路。这些挡我路的人是谁？看看他们中的大多数人是多么令人讨厌，看看他们在结账队伍中是多么愚蠢、像牛一样、目光呆滞、没有人性，或者看看人们在队伍中间大声讲手机是多么令人讨厌和粗鲁。看看这一切是多么的不公平。

Or, of course, if I’m in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, lane-blocking SUV’s and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, 40-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper-stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest \[responding here to loud applause\] — this is an example of how NOT to think, though — most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think about how our children’s children will despise us for wasting all the future’s fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on.  

当然，如果我的默认设置是一种更具社会意识的文科形式，我也可以花时间在交通末端，对所有巨大、愚蠢、挡住车道的 SUV、悍马和 V-12 皮卡感到厌恶，它们浪费、自私、燃烧着 40 加仑的油箱、我还可以沉浸在这样一个事实中：爱国或宗教保险杠贴纸似乎总是贴在最大、最令人厌恶的自私车辆上，由最丑陋的人驾驶\[在此回应热烈的掌声\]--但这是一个不应该思考的例子--最令人厌恶的自私车辆，由最丑陋、最不体贴、最咄咄逼人的司机驾驶。我还可以想一想，我们的子孙后代会如何鄙视我们，因为我们浪费了未来所有的燃料，可能还破坏了气候，我们是多么被宠坏、愚蠢、自私和令人作呕，现代消费社会是多么糟糕，等等等等。

You get the idea.  

你懂的。

If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn’t have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It’s the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I’m operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the centre of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world’s priorities.  

如果我在商店和高速公路上选择这样想，那很好。我们很多人都会这么做。只是这样想往往很容易，而且是自动的，不需要做出选择。这是我的自然默认设置。当我自动、无意识地认为我是世界的中心，我的切身需要和感受决定了世界的优先次序时，我就会以这种方式体验成人生活中无聊、沮丧、拥挤的部分。

The thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it’s not impossible that some of these people in SUV’s have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he’s trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he’s in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.  

当然，在这种情况下有完全不同的思考方式。在这样的车流中，所有这些车辆都停在我的面前，空转着，这并非不可能，其中一些开 SUV 的人过去曾遭遇过可怕的车祸，现在觉得开车太可怕了，以至于他们的心理医生都命令他们买一辆又大又重的 SUV，这样他们才能有足够的安全感去开车。或者说，刚才拦截我的那辆悍马车的驾驶者可能是一位父亲，他旁边的座位上坐着一个受伤或生病的小孩，他正试图把小孩送到医院，而他比我更着急、更理所当然：实际上是我挡了他的路。

Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket’s checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.  

或者，我也可以选择强迫自己去考虑这样一种可能性：超市里排队结账的其他人和我一样感到无聊和沮丧，其中有些人可能过着比我更艰难、更乏味、更痛苦的生活。

Again, please don’t think that I’m giving you moral advice, or that I’m saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because it’s hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won’t be able to do it, or you just flat out won’t want to.  

再次重申，请不要以为我在给你道德上的建议，也不要以为我在说你应该这样想，更不要以为任何人都希望你能自动这样做。因为这很难。这需要意志和努力，如果你和我一样，有些时候你做不到，或者你根本就不想做。

But most days, if you’re aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she’s not usually like this. Maybe she’s been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it’s also not impossible. It just depends what you want to consider. If you’re automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won’t consider possibilities that aren’t annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.  

但在大多数时候，如果你有足够的觉悟，给自己一个选择，你就可以选择用另一种眼光来看待这位胖胖的、死气沉沉的、过度化妆的女士，她刚刚在收银台前对着她的孩子大喊大叫。也许她平时不是这样的。也许她已经连续三个晚上没睡了，一直握着身患骨癌的丈夫的手。又或者，这位女士就是机动车辆部门的低薪职员，她昨天刚刚通过一些小小的官僚善举，帮助你的配偶解决了一个可怕的、令人恼火的、繁文缛节的问题。当然，这一切都不可能发生，但也不是不可能。这只取决于你想考虑什么。如果你固执地认为自己知道现实是什么，并按照自己的默认设置行事，那么你和我一样，可能不会考虑那些不令人讨厌和痛苦的可能性。但如果你真的学会了如何关注，你就会知道还有其他选择。实际上，在你的能力范围内，你可以体验到拥挤、炎热、缓慢、消费地狱式的环境不仅是有意义的，而且是神圣的，它燃烧着创造星星的同样力量：爱、友谊、万物深处神秘的一体性。

Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that’s capital-T True is that you get to decide how you’re gonna try to see it.  

并不是说那些神秘的东西就一定是真的。唯一大写的 "真 "是，你可以决定如何去理解它。

This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn’t. You get to decide what to worship.  

我认为，这才是真正教育的自由，才是学会如何适应的自由。你可以有意识地决定什么是有意义的，什么是没有意义的。你可以决定崇拜什么。

Because here’s something else that’s weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship–be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles–is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.  

因为这里还有一件奇怪但真实的事情：在成人生活的日常琐事中，实际上并不存在无神论。没有不崇拜这回事。每个人都崇拜。我们唯一的选择就是崇拜什么。选择崇拜某种神或精神类的东西--不管是耶稣基督还是真主，不管是耶和华还是巫术女神，不管是四圣谛还是某种不可侵犯的道德原则--令人信服的理由是，你崇拜的任何其他东西都会把你生吞活剥。如果你崇拜金钱和事物，如果它们是你挖掘人生真正意义的地方，那么你将永远不会拥有足够的东西，永远不会觉得自己拥有足够的东西。这是真理。崇拜你的身体、美貌和性诱惑，你就会永远觉得自己丑陋。当时间和年龄开始显现时，你会死上无数次，最后才会感到悲伤。在某种程度上，我们都已经知道这些东西。它已被编纂成神话、谚语、陈词滥调、寓言、比喻；每一个伟大故事的骨架。所有的诀窍都在于让真理在日常意识中保持领先。

Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or sinful, it’s that they’re unconscious. They are default settings.  

崇拜权力，你最终会感到软弱和恐惧，你会需要更多的权力来战胜他人，从而麻木自己的恐惧。崇拜智力，被视为聪明人，最终你会觉得自己很愚蠢，是个骗子，总是处于被发现的边缘。但这些崇拜形式的阴险之处并不在于它们是邪恶或罪恶的，而在于它们是无意识的。它们是默认设置。

They’re the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that’s what you’re doing.  

日复一日，你会逐渐陷入这种崇拜，对你所看到的东西和衡量价值的方式越来越挑剔，却从未完全意识到这就是你在做的事情。

And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving…. The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.  

所谓的现实世界并不会阻止你按照自己的默认设置行事，因为所谓的现实世界中，人、金钱和权力在恐惧、愤怒、挫折、渴望和自我崇拜中欢快地嗡嗡作响。我们现在的文化利用这些力量，创造了非凡的财富、舒适和个人自由。这种自由让我们成为自己渺小王国的主宰，独享万物之灵。这种自由有很多可取之处。当然，自由也有各种各样的种类，而最珍贵的自由，在这个充满欲望和成就的外部世界里，你不会听到太多的谈论....。真正重要的自由包括注意力、意识和纪律，以及能够真正关心他人，每天以无数琐碎、不性感的方式为他人做出牺牲。

That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.  

这才是真正的自由。这就是接受教育，懂得如何思考。另一种选择是无意识，是默认设置，是老鼠赛跑，是对曾经拥有和失去的无限东西的不断啃噬感。

I know that this stuff probably doesn’t sound fun and breezy or grandly inspirational the way a commencement speech is supposed to sound. What it is, as far as I can see, is the capital-T Truth, with a whole lot of rhetorical niceties stripped away. You are, of course, free to think of it whatever you wish. But please don’t just dismiss it as just some finger-wagging Dr Laura sermon. None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death.  

我知道，这些东西听起来可能并不像毕业典礼上的演讲那样风趣、轻松或鼓舞人心。在我看来，这就是大写的 "真理"，去掉了一大堆华丽的辞藻。当然，你可以随心所欲地看待它。但请不要把它当作是劳拉医生的说教。这些东西其实都与道德、宗教、教条或死后生活等花哨的大问题无关。

The capital-T Truth is about life BEFORE death.  

大写的 "真理 "是关于死亡之前的生命。

It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:  

这是关于真正教育的真正价值，它几乎与知识无关，而与简单的意识有关；意识到什么是如此真实和重要，如此隐藏在我们周围的众目睽睽之下，我们不得不一遍又一遍地提醒自己：

“This is water.” "这是水"

“This is water.” "这是水"

It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out. Which means yet another grand cliché turns out to be true: your education really IS the job of a lifetime. And it commences: now.  

要做到这一点，日复一日地在成人世界中保持清醒和活力，其难度是难以想象的。这意味着另一个陈词滥调变成了现实：你的教育确实是你一生的工作。现在就开始吧。

I wish you way more than luck.  

我祝愿你的不仅仅是好运。
