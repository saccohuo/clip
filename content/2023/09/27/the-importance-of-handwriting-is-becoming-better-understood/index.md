Two and a half millennia ago, Socrates complained that writing would harm students. With a way to store ideas permanently and externally, they would no longer need to memorise. It is tempting to dismiss him as an old man complaining about change. Socrates did not have a stack of peer-reviewed science to make his case about the usefulness of learning concepts by heart.  

两千五百年前，苏格拉底曾抱怨写作会伤害学生。有了一种永久性、外部存储思想的方法，他们就不再需要死记硬背了。人们很容易把他当作一个抱怨变革的老人。苏格拉底并没有一大堆经过同行评议的科学论文来证明死记硬背概念的有用性。

Today a different debate is raging about the dangers of another technology—computers—and the typing people do on them. As primary-school pupils and PhD hopefuls return for a new school year in the northern hemisphere, many will do so with a greater-than-ever [reliance on computers](https://www.economist.com/international/2014/06/07/taking-the-learning-tablets) to take notes and write papers. Some parents of younger students are dismayed that their children are not just encouraged but required to tote laptops to class. University professors complain of rampant distraction in classrooms, with students reading and messaging instead of listening to lectures.  

今天，一场关于另一种技术--计算机--以及人们在计算机上打字的危险性的辩论正在激烈进行。随着北半球的小学生和博士生们新学年的到来，许多人将比以往任何时候都更加依赖电脑来记笔记和写论文。一些低年级学生的家长感到沮丧的是，他们的孩子不仅被鼓励而且被要求带着笔记本电脑去上课。大学教授们抱怨说，课堂上分心现象十分严重，学生们不是在听讲，而是在看书和发信息。

A line of research shows the benefits of an “innovation” that predates computers: [handwriting](https://www.economist.com/1843/2012/10/08/handwriting-an-elegy). Studies have found that writing on paper can improve everything from recalling a random series of words to imparting a better conceptual grasp of complicated ideas.  

一项研究表明，手写这一早于计算机的 "创新 "也能带来益处。研究发现，在纸上书写可以提高一切能力，从随机记忆一系列单词到更好地掌握复杂的概念。

For learning material by rote, from the shapes of letters to the quirks of English spelling, the benefits of using a pen or pencil lie in how the motor and sensory memory of putting words on paper reinforces that material. The arrangement of squiggles on a page feeds into visual memory: people might remember a word they wrote down in French class as being at the bottom-left on a page, _par exemple_.  

对于死记硬背的学习材料，从字母的形状到英语拼写的怪异之处，使用钢笔或铅笔的好处在于将单词写在纸上的运动和感官记忆如何强化了这些材料。页面上方格的排列会影响视觉记忆：例如，人们可能会记得在法语课上写下的单词位于页面的左下方。

One of the best-demonstrated advantages of writing by hand seems to be in superior note-taking. In a study from 2014 by Pam Mueller and Danny Oppenheimer, students typing wrote down almost twice as many words and more passages verbatim from lectures, suggesting they were not understanding so much as rapidly copying the material.  

最能体现手写优势之一的似乎是超强的记笔记能力。在帕姆-穆勒（Pam Mueller）和丹尼-奥本海默（Danny Oppenheimer）于2014年进行的一项研究中，学生打字写下的单词数量和逐字记录的段落数量几乎是授课内容的两倍，这表明他们并不是在理解，而是在快速复制材料。

Handwriting—which takes longer for nearly all university-level students—forces note-takers to synthesise ideas into their own words. This aids conceptual understanding at the moment of writing. But those taking notes by hand also perform better on tests when students are later able to study from their notes. The effect even persisted when the students who typed were explicitly instructed to rephrase the material in their own words. The instruction was “completely ineffective” at reducing verbatim note-taking, the researchers note: they did not understand the material so much as parrot it.  

手写--几乎所有大学水平的学生都需要较长的时间--迫使记笔记者将想法综合成自己的文本。这有助于在书写时理解概念。但是，手写笔记的学生在考试中的表现也更好，因为他们以后可以根据笔记进行学习。当明确要求打字的学生用自己的话重新表述材料时，这种效果甚至依然存在。研究人员指出，这种指导在减少逐字记录方面 "完全无效"：他们并没有理解材料，只是鹦鹉学舌而已。

Many studies have confirmed handwriting’s benefits, and policymakers have taken note.  

许多研究证实了手写的益处，政策制定者也注意到了这一点。 Though America’s “Common Core” curriculum from 2010 does not require handwriting instruction past first grade (roughly age six), about half the states since then have mandated more teaching of it, thanks to campaigning by researchers and handwriting supporters.  

虽然 2010 年美国的 "共同内核 "课程并没有要求一年级（大约六岁）以后的手写教学，但在研究人员和手写支持者的推动下，此后大约有一半的州规定了更多的手写教学。 In Sweden there is a push for more handwriting and printed books and fewer devices. England’s national curriculum already prescribes teaching the rudiments of cursive by age seven.  

在瑞典，人们提倡更多的手写和印刷书籍，而减少设备。英国的全国课程已经规定在 7 岁之前教授草书的基本知识。

However, several school systems in America have gone so far as to ban most laptops. This is too extreme. Some students have disabilities that make handwriting especially hard. Nearly all will eventually need typing skills. And typing can improve the quality of writing: being able to get ideas down quickly, before they are forgotten, can obviously be beneficial. So can slowing down the speed of typing, says Dr Oppenheimer.  

然而，美国的一些学校系统竟然禁止使用大部分笔记本电脑。这种做法过于极端。有些学生有残疾，手写特别困难。几乎所有学生最终都需要打字技能。而打字可以提高写作质量：能够在想法被遗忘之前迅速记录下来显然是有益的。奥本海默博士说，放慢打字速度也有好处。

Virginia Berninger, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Washington, is a longtime advocate of handwriting. But she is not a purist; she says there are research-tested benefits for “manuscript” print-style writing, [for cursive](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2016/09/06/the-comeback-of-cursive) (which allows greater speed) but also for typing (which is good practice for composing passages). Since students spend more time on devices as they age, she argues for occasional “tuning up” of handwriting in later school years.  

华盛顿大学心理学名誉教授弗吉尼亚-伯宁格（Virginia Berninger）长期倡导手写。但她并不是一个纯粹主义者；她说，经过研究验证，"手稿 "印刷体书写、草书（速度更快）和打字（对撰写段落是很好的练习）都有好处。随着年龄的增长，学生使用设备的时间会越来越长，因此她主张在以后的学习阶段偶尔 "调整 "一下手写。

And perhaps even into adulthood. Johnson had not handwritten anything longer than a letter in decades before putting actual pen to paper to write this column’s first draft. Whether it made any difference to the outcome is a question that readers must decide.  

甚至可能一直到成年。在提笔写下这篇专栏的初稿之前，约翰逊已经几十年没有手写过比信更长的东西了。至于这是否会对结果产生任何影响，读者必须自己做出判断。

Socrates may or may not have had a point about the downsides of writing.  

关于写作的弊端，苏格拉底可能有，也可能没有。 But no one would remember, much less care, if his student Plato had not noted it down for the benefit of posterity.■  

但是，如果不是他的学生柏拉图为了后人的利益将其记录下来，没有人会记得，更不会有人关心。
