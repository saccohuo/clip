Illusion of competence. So you read an actionable, insightful book. You learn visually by highlighting the key points and underlying the key words.  

能力幻觉。 所以，你读了一本可操作的、有深刻见解的书。 你通过突出重点和关键词来直观地学习。

or maybe 5 minutes later, if you're like me, you try to tell your loved ones, your friends or family about all these amazing things that you've learned. But there's that awkward pause. .  

也许 5 分钟后，如果你像我一样，你会试图向你的爱人、朋友或家人讲述你学到的这些神奇的东西。 但是，就会出现尴尬的停顿。.

. Why can't I explain what I just learned? What was that idea again?  

. 为什么我不能解释我刚刚学到的东西？ 那个想法是什么来着？

! This happens to the best of us. It's called the illusion of competence.  

! 我们中最优秀的人都会遇到这种情况。 这就是所谓的能力幻觉。

The gist of it is all that underlining, all that highlighting, All that note taking is giving us the illusion that we're learning something new while our brain is just relaxing like a potato. So how to fix it? One way is to take smart notes.  

大意是，所有的下划线、所有的高亮标记、所有的笔记都在给我们造成一种错觉，以为我们在学习新知识，而我们的大脑却像土豆一样放松。 那么如何解决这个问题呢？ 方法之一就是做聪明的笔记。

Actually, no air quotes. These notes are actually smart. This is how Leonardo da Vinci took notes.  

实际上，没有空格引号。 这些笔记其实很聪明。 达芬奇就是这样记笔记的。

You know, the polymath genius who invented tanks, made scientific discoveries in astronomy, civil engineering, zoology, geometry, and had time to paint on the side, like the Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. Niklas Luhmann also used smart notes and published more than 70 books and almost 400 articles on the economy, Lore, politics, art, religion, media and even love. So if you want to become a powerful thinker, or you just want to remember the things that you've learned, smart Notes is going to help you do that.  

你知道，这位多才多艺的天才发明了坦克，在天文学、土木工程、动物学、几何学等领域取得了科学发现，还有时间画画，比如《最后的晚餐》和《蒙娜丽莎》。 尼克拉斯-卢曼还使用智能笔记，出版了 70 多本书和近 400 篇文章，内容涉及经济、洛尔、政治、艺术、宗教、媒体甚至爱情。 因此，如果你想成为一个强大的思想家，或者你只是想记住你所学到的东西，smart Notes 将帮助你做到这一点。

There are 3 things that make smart notes smart. The first one is smart notes are active, meaning that they're not passive highlights, underlines and notes that just follow the author's flow. Instead, it's about actively restructuring other people's thoughts into your own structure.  

智能笔记之所以智能，有三点。 第一点是智能笔记是主动的，也就是说，它不是被动的高亮、下划线和笔记，只是跟着作者的思路走。 相反，它是主动地将他人的思想重组为自己的结构。

Now, you might ask, Well, what is my structure? Well, if you don't already have one, here's a great one to get started: It's called Q/E/C. Q/E/C.  

现在，你可能会问，那我的结构是什么？ 好吧，如果你还没有，这里有一个很好的开始：它叫做 Q/E/C。 Q/E/C。

It stands for Question, Evidence and Conclusion. This is what I used in law school Even if you are not studying for law, this still works because Professor Cal Newport from Georgetown University, who's written lots of books on a deep work on time blocking on digital productivity, he uses this method, and actually he was the one that named this the Q/E/C Note-Taking method. You look for only 3 things when you're reading: the questions, the evidence and the conclusion.  

它代表问题、证据和结论。 这是我在法学院使用的方法，即使你不是学法律的，这个方法仍然有效，因为乔治敦大学的卡尔-纽波特教授写了很多关于数字生产力的时间阻断方面的著作，他使用了这个方法，实际上是他把这个方法命名为 Q/E/C 笔记法。 你在阅读时只需寻找三样东西：问题、证据和结论。

This way it doesn't matter what you're reading, which order the author puts his ideas in. You can always find these three things and link them together. Professor Newport even has a system for identifying them while you read.  

这样一来，你在读什么，作者的观点是按什么顺序排列的，都不重要了。 你总能找到这三样东西，并将它们联系在一起。 纽波特教授甚至有一套在阅读时识别它们的系统。

For any conclusions, ideas, you put a dot next to it. For the evidence and examples, you put a dash across it. And when you review your notes, you think about which question are these ideas trying to answer and which evidence links to these ideas.  

对于任何结论、观点，都要在旁边打一个点。 至于证据和例子，则在旁边画一个破折号。 当你回顾笔记时，你要思考这些观点试图回答哪个问题，哪些证据与这些观点相关联。

Let me give you a quick example with the book Atomic Habits. James Clear, like his name, he's a very clear writer. So, many of his headings are actually already questions.  

让我以《原子习惯》一书为例，给大家举个简单的例子。 詹姆斯-克莱尔，就像他的名字一样，他是一位非常清晰的作家。 因此，他的许多标题实际上已经是问题了。

Then you go down the page and you look for new ideas and put a dot next to them. He gives great examples and anecdotes, so you put a dash across them. Once you've finished reading a section, then you can put all these notes together.  

然后再往下看，寻找新的想法，并在旁边打上点。 他举了很多好的例子和轶事，你就在这些例子和轶事上画上破折号。 当你读完一个章节后，就可以把所有这些笔记放在一起。

Start with question, give the evidence and write the conclusion down. This is how it can look like. Now, most people stop here, right?  

从问题开始，给出证据并写下结论。 它可以是这样的。 现在，大多数人都到此为止了，对吗？

I've got the question. I've got the evidence I've got the conclusion. What more do I need?  

我有问题 我有证据，我有结论。 我还需要什么？

A-ha. This is where you are going to outsmart others. Because the next thing about smart notes is that they are atomic.  

啊哈 这就是你要比别人聪明的地方。 因为智能笔记的下一个特点就是它们是原子式的。

The size of your notes and the ideas on them matter. When other people are organizing their notes in one giant document, whether digitally or in notebook, you do something different. You make your notes atomic.  

笔记的大小和上面的想法很重要。 当其他人把笔记整理成一个巨大的文档时，无论是数字文档还是笔记本文档，你的做法都与众不同。 你要让你的笔记原子化。

This is a classic example of how tools actually shape and limit how you can think. Think about it. If you use a giant word doc, how do you think?  

这是一个典型的例子，说明了工具实际上是如何塑造和限制你的思维方式的。 想想看。 如果你使用一个巨大的 word doc，你会如何思考？

You think vertically, right? You think chronologically, you think A, then B, then C. If you take away A and C, all of a sudden you can't really remember what was B.  

你是纵向思考的，对吧？ 如果去掉 A 和 C，突然间你就不记得 B 是什么了。

But if you use atomic ideas not in one giant document, but each idea stands alone by itself, then you can think in 3D, right? You can think up and down, left to right. You can think diagonally.  

但是，如果你不是在一个巨大的文档中使用原子想法，而是每个想法都独立存在，那么你就可以进行三维思考，对吗？ 你可以上下左右思考。 你可以对角思考。

You can think about this pile and that pile. All of a sudden your ideas come alive. This is what Charlie Munger was talking about when he said "The first rule is that you can't really know anything If you just remember isolate the facts and try and bang 'em back.  

你可以想这一堆，也可以想那一堆。 突然之间，你的想法就活灵活现了。 这就是查理-芒格（Charlie Munger）所说的 "第一条规则是，如果你只记住孤立的事实，并试图把它们撞回去，你就不可能真正了解任何事情。

If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, don't have them in a usable form. " So once you've got your Q/E/C's, you want each Q, each E, each C - each question, each evidence, each conclusion to be its own atomic note, because in the next step we are going to rearrange them. Especially if you're using the Zettelkasten method, making your ideas atomic is going to make all the difference.  

如果这些事实不能在理论的格子上组合起来，就不要以可用的形式出现。"所以，一旦你有了 Q/E/C，你就希望每个 Q、每个 E、每个 C，即每个问题、每个证据、每个结论都是自己的原子音符，因为下一步我们要重新排列它们。 尤其是在使用 Zettelkasten 方法的情况下，让你的想法原子化会让一切都变得不同。

Because the third thing that makes smart notes smart is that they are connected, which means one, we've already connected ideas with the Q/E/C method. But there's a two, which is outside of these new things That you've learned, you also want to connect new ideas to existing ideas, things that you already know. This is how we will combat the illusion of competence.  

因为智能笔记之所以智能，第三点就在于它们是有联系的，这意味着一，我们已经用 Q/E/C 方法把想法联系起来了。 但还有第二点，那就是在你学到的这些新东西之外，你还想把新想法与现有想法、你已经知道的东西联系起来。 这就是我们对抗能力幻觉的方法。

The way to get out of the illusion is to make sure you're latching your new ideas onto existing ones. And how do you do that? You can try the compass of the Zettelkasten thinking.  

摆脱这种幻觉的方法就是确保将新想法与现有想法相结合。 如何做到这一点呢？ 你可以试试Zettelkasten思维指南针。

I learned this one from my friend Fei. You take one idea in the middle and you think in four different directions. North is: Where does this idea come from?  

这是我从朋友阿飞那里学来的。 你把一个想法放在中间，然后从四个不同的方向思考。 北边是这个想法从何而来？

West is: What's similar to this idea? East is: What competes with this idea? And South is: Where can this idea link to next?  

西方是：与这个想法相似的是什么？ 东方是：与这个想法竞争的是什么？ 南边是：这个创意的下一个目标是什么？

Let me give you an example from Atomic Habits again. "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.  

让我再举一个《原子习惯》中的例子。 "你不会上升到你的目标的高度。 你会跌落到你的系统的水平。

" Let's use that as the main idea. Okay, so let's go north. Where does this idea come from?  

"让我们用这个作为大意。 好吧，我们往北走。 这个想法从何而来？

Well, James Clear says it comes from goal oriented thinking that most of us do. But the problem is that winners and losers have the same goals, right? So what's different?  

詹姆斯-克利说，这源于我们大多数人的目标导向思维。 但问题是，赢家和输家的目标是一样的，对吗？ 那有什么不同呢？

It's the systems they set that help them achieve those goals. Okay, then let's go West. What's similar to this idea of don't focus on goals, focus on the system?  

正是他们制定的制度帮助他们实现了这些目标。 好吧，那我们去西部看看。 与 "不要关注目标，要关注系统 "这一理念相似的是什么？

Well, systems thinking is exactly about this idea. I've talked about it in detail here. But the gist is that you want to troubleshoot a system to make sure that you're reaching your eventual goal.  

嗯，系统思维正是关于这种想法的。 我曾在这里详细谈过。 但要点是，你要对系统进行故障排除，以确保达到最终目标。

So just like how we manage large organizations, we can apply similar principles in our habit formations. Okay, then let's go east. What competes with this idea of focus on systems, not goals?  

因此，就像我们如何管理大型组织一样，我们也可以将类似的原则应用到我们的习惯养成中。 好，那我们往东走。 是什么与 "关注系统而非目标 "这一理念相冲突呢？

What's opposite? What's missing? Well, we can say that goal setting is important.  

什么是相反的？ 缺少了什么？ 嗯，我们可以说，制定目标很重要。

Right. It gives us a direction to go towards and then have the system that get you there. But if your goals are wrong and you are on the wrong trajectory, then it doesn't matter how good your system is, you're not going to get to where you want to go.  

没错。 它给了我们一个前进的方向，然后有一个能让你到达目的地的系统。 但是，如果你的目标是错误的，你的轨迹是错误的，那么无论你的系统有多好，你都无法到达你想去的地方。

Goal setting has to happen first, but then you need the systems. All right, then, let's go south. Where does the idea of goals and systems lead to?  

首先要设定目标，然后才需要系统。 好吧，我们往南走。 目标和系统的概念指向哪里？

Well, as James Clear said himself, is not just about forming good habits. It's also about breaking bad habits. Forming atomic habits has helped people with addiction, with weight loss goals.  

那么，正如詹姆斯-克利尔自己所说的那样，这不仅仅是养成好习惯的问题。 还要改掉坏习惯。 养成原子习惯有助于人们戒除毒瘾，实现减肥目标。

Coming back to systems thinking and larger organizations. Maybe we can apply the same principles and help organizations break bad habits Like problems in diversity, like protecting the environment. Wow.  

回到系统思维和大型组织上来。 也许我们可以运用同样的原则，帮助组织打破坏习惯，比如在多样性方面的问题，比如保护环境。 哇哦

Just by thinking in four different directions, we're coming up with ways to solve climate change and diversity issues. Connecting ideas is essential. And if you want to take your smart note, taking to the next level, then make sure you check out my Zettelkasten guide and I'll see you in the next one.  

只要从四个不同的方向思考，我们就能想出解决气候变化和多样性问题的办法。 把想法联系起来是至关重要的。 如果你想让你的智能笔记更上一层楼，那么一定要看看我的 Zettelkasten 指南，我们下期再见。

Bye!  再见！
