Walter Isaacson's [new book about Elon Musk](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-Walter-Isaacson-ebook/dp/B0BW9TRGKV/) is a fine biography, but an even better business book.  

沃尔特-艾萨克森（Walter Isaacson）关于埃隆-马斯克（Elon Musk）的新书是一本优秀的传记，更是一本优秀的商业书籍。 And like all the best business books, it's not merely an instruction manual, but an inspirational guide too. Not since reading [Ricardo Semler's Maverick](https://www.amazon.com/Maverick-Success-Behind-Unusual-Workplace/dp/0446670553/) in the early 2000s have I been this impressed with the foresight, fortitude, and ferocity of a founder. Musk is truly one of a kind.  

与所有优秀的商业书籍一样，这本书不仅是一本指导手册，也是一本鼓舞人心的指南。自从 2000 年代初读过里卡多-塞姆勒（Ricardo Semler）的《特立独行者》（Maverick）一书后，我对创始人的远见卓识、坚韧不拔和勇猛无畏的精神印象深刻。马斯克确实是独一无二的。

I know positive statements like that about Musk can trigger some people. Most have already formed their opinion of the man, and, especially in technology, it's typically a polarized one. Either the man is the second coming of capitalist christ or he's the devil's conman incarnate. Ironically, like many of the most interesting people to ever grace this earth, there are shimmers of truth in both caricatures.

  

我知道，像这样正面评价马斯克的言论会引发一些人的反感。大多数人已经形成了对他的看法，尤其是在科技领域，这种看法通常是两极分化的。要么认为他是资本主义基督的第二次降临，要么认为他是魔鬼骗子的化身。具有讽刺意味的是，就像地球上许多最有趣的人一样，这两幅漫画中都闪烁着真理的光芒。

That's why Isaacson's book is such an enjoyable biography. You could quote a hundred passages supporting either position. His entrepreneurial achievements are as incontestable as his maniacal, even masochistic, commitment to a HARDCORE work ethic. The latter seems as much motivated by escaping personal demons as by moving the needle. But the needle also does move!

  

这就是为什么艾萨克森的书是一本令人愉快的传记。你可以引用上百个段落来支持任何一种立场。他的创业成就与他对艰苦工作的狂热，甚至是受虐狂式的承诺一样，都是无可争议的。后者的动机似乎更多的是为了摆脱个人恶魔，而不是为了实现目标。但指针也确实在移动！

The part of the business book I've enjoyed the most is the countless illustrations of how Musk applies his "algorithm". A methodology for shipping everything from electric cars to Mars rockets to flamethrowers to humanoid robots. Quoted in full:

  

在这本商业书籍中，我最喜欢的部分是马斯克如何应用他的 "算法 "的无数插图。从电动汽车到火星火箭，从火焰喷射器到人形机器人，马斯克的方法论无所不能。全文引用：

1.  **Question every requirement**. Each should come with the name of the person who made it. You should never accept that a requirement came from a department, such as from "the legal department" or "the safety department." You need to know the name of the real person who made that requirement. Then you should question it, no matter how smart that person is. Requirements from smart people are the most dangerous, because people are less likely to question them. Always do so, even if the requirement came from me. Then make the requirements less dumb.   
    
    询问每一项要求。每项要求都应注明提出者的姓名。你绝不能接受某项要求来自某个部门，如 "法律部门 "或 "安全部 门"。你需要知道真正提出要求的人的姓名。然后，无论这个人有多聪明，你都应该提出质疑。来自聪明人的要求是最危险的，因为人们不太可能提出质疑。一定要这样做，即使要求来自于我。然后让要求不那么愚蠢。
2.  **Delete any part or process you can**. You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn't delete enough.  
    
    删除任何可以删除的部分或流程。以后可能还得再添加。事实上，如果你最终没有添加回至少 10%的部分，那就说明你删得还不够多。
3.  **Simplify and optimize**. This should come after step two. common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that should not exist.  
    
    简化和优化。这应该在第二步之后进行。常见的错误是简化和优化不应该存在的部分或流程。
4.  **Accelerate cycle time**. Every process can be speeded up. But only do this after you have followed the first three steps. In the Tesla factory, I mistakenly spent a lot of time accelerating processes that I later realized should have been deleted.   
    
    加快循环时间。每个流程都可以加速。但只有在完成前三个步骤后，才能这样做。在特斯拉工厂，我错误地花了大量时间加速那些后来才意识到应该删除的流程。
5.  **Automate**. That comes last. The big mistake in Nevada and at Fremont was that I began by trying to automate every step. We should have waited until all the requirements had been questioned, parts and processes deleted, and the bugs were shaken out.  
    
    自动化。这一点放在最后。在内华达州和弗里蒙特犯下的大错是，我一开始就试图将每个步骤自动化。我们本应等到所有的要求都被质疑、部件和流程被删除、错误被清除之后再做决定。

This not just a succinct distillation of a practical and powerful work method but one for a successful company culture too. And this is how Musk runs his companies. Isaacson's book is easily worth the read for the countless case studies illustrating exactly how these points are applied.  

这不仅是一种实用而强大的工作方法的简明提炼，也是一种成功的企业文化。马斯克就是这样经营他的公司的。艾萨克森的书值得一读，因为书中有无数案例确切地说明了这些要点是如何应用的。

The trick to getting the best out of Musk's method is to realize that you needn't celebrate the madness as much as merely accept that it's part of a package deal. Like it so often is. One of the memorable quotes from the book reveals that even Musk himself realizes this: "Did you think I was just going to be a normal, chill dude?".

  

从马斯克的方法中获得最佳收益的诀窍在于认识到，你无需庆祝疯狂，而只需接受它是一揽子交易的一部分。就像它经常发生的那样。书中有一句令人难忘的话表明，连马斯克自己也意识到了这一点："你以为我只是一个普通的、冷酷的家伙吗？

You can absolutely learn from people you wouldn't want to be. Extracting wisdom from Musk's success does not oblige you to become his disciple or his mirror. Besides, you'd probably fail miserably in an attempt of the latter anyway.

  

你完全可以向你不愿成为的人学习。从马斯克的成功中汲取智慧，并不意味着你必须成为他的弟子或镜子。况且，无论如何，你都可能会在后者的尝试中惨败。

A key reason Musk gets away with his madness is that the missions he pursue can motivate people to persevere in spite of him. So unless you're also trying to single-handedly accelerate the energy transition of earth or attempting to colonize Mars, you'd best dilute his example accordingly.

  

马斯克能够逍遥法外的一个重要原因是，他所追求的使命能够激励人们不畏艰险，坚持不懈。因此，除非你也想以一己之力加速地球能源转型或试图殖民火星，否则最好相应地淡化他的榜样作用。

That seems to be a lesson that's currently lost to the ages. The ability to appreciate, applaud, and even partly appropriate elements of a character you'd never wish to swallow whole. I can shake my head as much as anyone about some of Musk's antics, and yet still be ever-so-pleased that he's here, doing what he does.

  

这似乎是目前已经失传的一课。能够欣赏、称赞甚至部分适当地接受一个你永远不希望全盘接受的角色的元素。对于马斯克的一些滑稽行为，我和其他人一样会摇头，但我仍然为他的存在和所作所为感到高兴。

Most founders and executives would do well to add at least 10% of Musk's intensity to their personal recipe. You can do that and still believe that [It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work](https://basecamp.com/books/calm) or that [REMOTE](https://basecamp.com/books/remote) is a compelling way of work and life for many or even most.  

  

大多数创始人和高管都希望在自己的个人食谱中至少加入10%马斯克的强度。你可以做到这一点，但仍然相信 "工作不必太疯狂 "或 "REMOTE "对许多人甚至大多数人来说是一种令人信服的工作和生活方式。
