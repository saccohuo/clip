Thanks for tuning and again this video will be covering the best piece of advice that I ever got about drawing in fact the advice that changed my life holy freaking click babe I'm making this video cause the top comment on the last video I made the AMA was about the advice that I shared right at the end and I think I want this channel to have a little bit of that element where there's a bit of utility for other Creative people or just other people in general so hope you'll like it buckle-up apologies about the background and handheld mic I'm still in Sri Lanka so we've still got the newsreader in the middle of nowhere vibe for heck let's go in 2016 I was a totally different guy I was still what I'll call creative but I was very very scattered about it and at the time I was working for a guy called Mark Shatner who was an eccentric artist him and his wife Julie would make these Dog and rabbit people's sculptures you might have seen them they're pretty stunning and what they do is just that all they do is make these dog and rabbits cultures sometimes they're on a moped they make his paintings homewares you name it now I really liked mark Shatner I really liked what he was about and I was really impressed with the fact that he managed to make art his full-time gig one time I said how many days a week do you make art and he Responded without even thinking it was weird he goes all of them and I was like seven and he goes yeah all seven why at the time that blew my mind it wouldn't blow my mind now cuz now I know what it's like to find something that you love enough to do seven days a week where it doesn't even feel like work it feels like a day's wasted if you haven't done it but at the time I was like dude what anyway his passion was super contagious very fun wacky creative guy Me though I was kind of young and angsty and I did what young angsty people do best I complained I'd be like mark I didn't get it you're an artist you make all this stuff you've kind of got this whole world this whole stuff that you can just milk and do all the time I feel creative why can't I do that just nice when G language and one day I guess the complaining had got to an all-time high and he gave me a bit of tough love He said Campbell you know what your problem is one day you write a song the next day you write a poem and then the third day you do a drawing and none of it adds up to anything all you're doing is laying a single brick of a million different houses and expecting that one day it'll magically become a mansion it's not gonna happen it hit me like a ton of miss laid bricks man he'd identified the problem perfectly I was scattered Casey Neistat has a little bit about this as well where he says you can do 10 things to like the first degree like this right here and that's how well you'll do all 10 things or you can do one thing to the 10th degree right there and look how much better you do that naturally my next question was all right mark we know what's wrong with me how do I fix it and this is where the advice came in he just said draw the same thing every single Day he's like you've got so many mediums I'll pick one for you it's gonna be drawing and what you're gonna do is just draw the exact same thing every single day just try it for a year and then we'll reassess I don't have anything to lose and this guy knew a lot more about Hart than I did so I took his advice the only problem left to solve was what I was gonna draw and as Mark's advice was marinating in my head as I walked Home from work I walked through the park but I always walked through and it was full of this one particular bird called the itis you might know the Ibis is the Egyptian god Thoth or if you're from Australia you'll know them as the bin chicken they're a big white bird with a black head who hangs around rubbish bins and eats trash for me they just seemed like the perfect metaphor for humanity we could fly we could do anything we want And yet we roll around and bin juice I loved it once known as the white ibis the species has evolved into a superior scavenger from the city's rooftops the bin chicken has spotted something bins so I went to the pub and I drew this then I drew this then I drew this I ended up drawing nine of irises that night and I posted them to Instagram and I started to going to get a sense that I was building something I started to get a sense that I was laying bricks of the Same house that was only the first day the second day rolls around and I drew another Ibis there's not a brick in my house third day another Ibis fourth fifth tens twenty or thirty eighth day I just keep drawing these ibises like mark said and you know what happened I got really bored of drawing ibises but I still wanted to commit to the advice so I was like well shoot if I'm going to draw irises I may as well make them interesting screwed I'm gonna add chokes So I start adding jokes to the irises just little comments about my city little bits of social commentary and I get really into that I get really into the social commentary that comes along with the irises to the point where the irises by the hundredth iris just starts to take a bit of a backseat to said social commentary and it's at this point that I realized the brilliance of Mark Shatner's advice he wasn't telling me to draw an iris he was just telling me to Start because once I start only then will I find the thing that I'm looking for but I would never have got there if I hadn't drawn the eye this every single day and this is true for work this is true for like dating versus committing yourself to one person friendship everything like really focusing and investing yourself into something you're passionate about will always yield better results then scattering yourself around and spreading yourself thin so That's the best bit of advice that I've ever saved but why is it so good well I've put it down to four raisins the first quantity leads to quality I've said this before I mean it's the reason that my videos are now gonna be 70% instead of 100% perfect I just truly believe that and for me to approach quantity I had to take out the decision-making process of what to draw which mark Shanna did so eloquently so the second reason that I really like This advice is because it promotes constraints for creativity once again we'll look at the blank page the blank page is one of the most freakishly intimidating things we've all been there we've all stared at it we've all tapped it with our pens it's very very annoying but compare a blank page with a blank page that says draw an Ibis or a blank page that says draw a robot or a flying horse or any kind of tight brief immediately having a constraint lets you Know exactly what you're going to be doing which leads me to the third reason action comes before motivation it's not the other way around I think there's this myth that motivation leads to action that you've gotta wait for some sort of moment of inspiration that strikes you like lightning from the gods but it's the other way around firstly you need to act and only then will you find your motivation so for me I needed to draw every single day and I Needed to build up that habit before I could probably be motivated to draw what I actually felt like drawing now the fourth and final reason that this was incredible advice I was using thinking as a form of procrastination there's a story about a donkey who wants some hay and want some water but the donkey doesn't know which one to go to first so the donkey looks at the hay looks at the water looks at the hay looks at the water I'm a hungry and my Thirsty and my hungry and my thirsty and eventually the donkey dies of dehydration what a dumb donkey I was the donkey I was dumb I was like should I make this should I make that should I make this and you know what I didn't start but I felt productive because I was thinking about it but thinking about stuff is not doing stuff it's the complete opposite of doing stuff and I was in a trap with this deliberation and this pondering and his Questioning in this thinking the strategizing and debating all felt like they were moving me forward but they weren't and Mark Shatner's advice of just draw one thing every day got me out of that I think if you're only good at one thing that's what you do and with both of us it wasn't as though you know it had to be art it was that we were particularly good at anything else so there it is some advice I hope it resonates with you I hope particularly In this time of January when productivity is an all-time high we're all a little bit drunk off New Year's resolutions and the feeling of reinventing yourself in 2020 and all this new decade kind of hype I hope that the advice can help you um translate some of that into action let me know what you thought hope you liked the 70% video vibe once again stuck to the weekly upload gonna see if I can make a whole year of It I'm kind of excited by the challenge who knows who knows we'll see how we go until I'm back at home I can't really do any more drawing videos because I don't have all the equipment so hopefully you don't mind the talking to camera vibe hopefully there's still some value in it subscribe if you unless you didn't like it in which case go for a run gotcha you thought it was over but there's one last thing that I want to show you when I was Drawing all those irises there was part of me that wanted to expect there was a part of me that wanted to bring the ibis drawings to life plus earlier I did say watch to the end so here it is the first ever animation I made of an Ibis hey what's up judges from Australian Ivers my name is Tosh I'm from Newcastle but now I live in Newtown so it's kind of like nuit de nuit snapchat hi Tasha and get her haha a little bit about me I play guitar I Love music I love she gaze and mostly I play covers and mostly I play covers of no diggity so I think that I should be on Australian Ivor's because I really represent what's going on right now in second year psych students like this kind of like undercurrent of like you know ah you use it creative collective it's like I think that like my generation is kind of like on it and I feel like I'm really honest so I think that if Australian hiatus was like Lentils anything in Dubai what do you think it's worth I would probably win but I know it's no no it's like a democracy and stuff because it's like whatever but anyway thanks for watching I hope you found something this video that makes me want to put me on the show love - snapchat - Caze love a vinyl instead of wood \[Music\] you  

感谢您收看本视频，本视频将再次介绍我得到的关于绘画的最佳建议，事实上，这些建议改变了我的生活。 希望你们会喜欢，抱歉我的背景和手持麦克风，我还在斯里兰卡，所以我们还能看到新闻播报员在荒郊野外的身影。 我很喜欢马克-夏特纳，我很喜欢他的作品，他把艺术作为自己的全职工作给我留下了深刻的印象，有一次我问他，你一周有多少天从事艺术创作？ 他想都没想就回答说："很奇怪，他说所有的，我说七个，他说是的，所有的七个。"当时我觉得很不可思议，但现在不会了，因为现在我知道了，找到自己喜欢的事情，一周做七天是什么感觉。 有一天，我想我的抱怨达到了前所未有的高度，他给了我一点严厉的爱。 他说："坎贝尔，你知道你的问题是什么吗？一天你写一首歌，第二天你写一首诗，第三天你画一幅画，但你所做的一切都没有任何意义。 我被分散凯西Neistat有一点点关于这一点，他说，你可以做10件事情，像这样的第一程度，就在这里，这是你会做所有10件事情，或者你可以做一件事，到第10度就在那里，看看有多少更好，你做的，自然，我的下一个问题是所有权利标记，我们知道什么是错的，我怎么解决这个问题，这是在哪里的建议来了，他只是说画同样的事情，每一个单一的 他说，你有这么多的媒介，我给你选一种，那就是画画，你要做的就是每天画完全一样的东西，先试一年，然后我们再重新评估。 下班回家，我穿过公园，但我总是穿过公园，公园里到处都是一种特别的鸟，叫伊比鸟，你可能知道伊比鸟是埃及的托特神，如果你来自澳大利亚，你会知道它们叫垃圾鸡，它们是一种白色的大鸟，头是黑色的，在垃圾桶周围游荡，吃垃圾，对我来说，它们似乎是人类的完美隐喻，我们可以飞翔，我们可以做任何我们想做的事 我喜欢它，它曾被称为白鹮，如今已进化成城市屋顶上的高级食腐动物，这只垃圾鸡发现了垃圾桶里的东西，于是我去了酒吧，画了这个，然后又画了这个，最后我画了九个鸢尾花，那天晚上我把它们发到了Instagram上，我开始有一种感觉，我在建造什么，我开始有一种感觉，我在铺设 "鸢尾花 "的砖块。 同样的房子，这只是第一天，第二天我又画了一只朱鹮，我的房子里没有一块砖 第三天，又画了一只朱鹮 第四天，第五天，第六天，第七天，第八天，我就像马克说的那样一直画这些朱鹮，你知道发生了什么吗，我真的厌倦了画朱鹮，但我还是想坚持我的建议，所以我就想，好吧，如果我要画鸢尾花，我不妨让它们变得有趣些，拧了拧，我要加上窒息物 于是，我开始在虹膜上加一些笑话，只是对我所在城市的一些小评论，一些社会评论，我真的很喜欢这样，我真的很喜欢虹膜所带来的社会评论，以至于虹膜画到第 100 个虹膜的时候，就开始有点退居二线了。 开始，因为只有开始了，我才会找到我在寻找的东西，但如果我没有每天都这样吸引眼球，我永远也不会找到，这对工作是正确的，这对约会是正确的，而不是把自己投入到一个人的友谊中，一切都像真正的专注，把自己投入到你所热衷的事情中，总是会产生更好的结果，而不是分散自己的精力，把自己摊得很薄，所以，这对工作是正确的，这对约会是正确的，而不是把自己投入到一个人的友谊中，一切都像真正的专注，把自己投入到你所热衷的事情中，总是会产生更好的结果。 这是我听过的最好的建议 但为什么这么好呢 我把它归结为四点 第一 量变导致质变 我以前说过这个 我是说这是我的视频现在要达到70% 而不是100%完美的原因 白纸是最可怕的东西之一，我们都经历过，我们都盯着它看，我们都用笔敲过它，它非常非常令人讨厌。 我认为有这样一种说法，即动机导致行动，你必须等待某种灵感的到来，就像来自天神的闪电一样击中你，但事实恰恰相反，首先你需要行动，然后才能找到你的动机。 有一个关于驴子的故事，驴子想要一些干草，也想要一些水，但驴子不知道先去哪一个，所以驴子看着干草，看着水，看着干草，看着水。 渴了，我饿了，我渴了，最后驴子脱水而死，真是一头蠢驴，我就是那头驴子，我很蠢，我想我应该做这个，我应该做那个，我应该做这个，你知道吗，我没有开始做，但我觉得我很有成就感，因为我在思考，但思考不是做事情，它与做事情完全相反。 马克-夏特纳（Mark Shatner）的建议是每天只画一件事，这让我摆脱了这种状态，我想如果你只擅长一件事，那你就会去做，而且我们俩都不擅长艺术，所以这就是一些建议，我希望能引起你的共鸣，我特别希望如此。 在这个生产力达到历史最高点的一月，我们都有点沉醉于新年决议和 2020 年重塑自我的感觉，以及所有这些新十年的炒作，我希望这些建议可以帮助你，嗯，将其中的一些转化为行动，让我知道你的想法，希望你喜欢这 70% 的视频氛围，再次坚持每周上传，看看我是否能做出一整年的视频。 我对这个挑战有点兴奋，谁知道呢，谁知道呢，我们会看到我们如何去，直到我回到家里，我真的不能做任何更多的绘画视频，因为我没有所有的设备，所以希望你不介意说话的相机氛围，希望还有一些价值，如果你订阅，除非你不喜欢它，在这种情况下，去运行得到了你以为它已经结束了，但还有最后一件事，我想告诉你，当我是 在绘制所有这些鸢尾花的过程中，有一部分我想把朱鹮的图画变为现实，而且我之前说过要看完，所以这就是我第一次制作的朱鹮动画，嘿，大家好，我是来自澳大利亚艾弗斯的法官，我叫托什，来自纽卡斯尔，但现在我住在纽敦，所以这有点像nuit de nuit snapchat，嗨，塔莎，叫上她，哈哈，关于我的一些情况，我会弹吉他。 我爱音乐，我爱她的凝视，主要是我玩的封面，主要是我玩没有diggity的封面，所以我觉得我应该在澳大利亚艾弗的，因为我真的代表了什么是怎么回事，现在在二年级的心理学生喜欢这种像暗流，就像你知道啊，你用它创造性的集体，这就像我觉得像我们这一代是有点像在它，我觉得我真的很诚实，所以我觉得，如果澳大利亚的休会是像 迪拜的小扁豆 你觉得它值多少钱 我可能会赢，但我知道这是不可能的，这就像一个民主之类的东西，因为它就像什么，但无论如何，感谢您的收看，我希望你找到的东西，这个视频，让我想把我的节目爱 - snapchat - Caze爱乙烯基而不是木头\[音乐\]你
