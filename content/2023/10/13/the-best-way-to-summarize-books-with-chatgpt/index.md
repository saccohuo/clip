I just can't believe by the way that I'm sitting here watching an artificial intelligence write what would have taken me many many hours of focus writing to do look at \[Music\] it we live in the future \[Music\] folks if you're new here hi my name is Thiago Forte and I'm the author of building a second brain which is all About how to maximize the value you get from all the content and information you can consume every day in this video I'll share what I've learned about how to effectively use chat GPT to summarize books then I'll take you step by step through a real example of creating a book summary so you can do it yourself I used to Read 50 books a year speeding through them like my life depended on it until one day I realized none of this is sticking I'm reading Thousands of words every month but it's just passing in one ear and out the other I don't know about you but I want my reading to actually make a difference in my life so a few years ago I decided to start reading far fewer books and to summarize them in my own words so that knowledge really sunk in these summaries are like building blocks that I've been able to incorporate into my work or share with others to their benefit instead of this vague feeling that I'm Forgetting everything I learn I can see this tangible collection of book summaries as proof of what I've learned writing book summaries is extremely timeconsuming it's hard enough to find the time to read a book in the first place but to then set aside additional hours to summarize it especially when I became a parent a few years ago I suddenly had zero time for that when chat GPT came out I realized this could be a way to create my book Summaries in a fraction of the time the question is is can we get high quality book summaries from chat GPT at first I tried simply asking chat GPT to write a summary on its own but even after trying this multiple times in multiple ways I found that these summaries are just not good they're too brief superficial cliche they fail to capture the most unusual insightful important ideas from the book The problem I discovered is that chat GPT doesn't have direct access To the text of the book itself it's relying on summaries already written by others and a summary of a summary is never good luckily I do have access to the full text specifically I highlight ebooks as I read and using a service called readwise which you can find out more about in this video I have all my highlights from over 200 books automatically saved right here in my not app I found that if I feed my highlights which include all the points I found Most surprising resonant thought-provoking into chat GPT it produces a far better summary step one read the ebook and Export just the highlights to your digital notak app I decided to read the book where good ideas come from by Steven Johnson in the Kindle app on my iPad as I read I highlighted the best passages all of which were automatically saved to my digital notes using using readwise step two go through those Highlights and bold the most important interesting resonant points here's the issue most of the time the highlights I save from a book are far too extensive as you can see here this amounts to 8,000 words from just this one book alone which is about double what chat GPT allows so I usually find that I need to do a first pass selecting only the most important parts the way I do that first pass is using my Progressive summarization technique keep in mind That what you see here in the note is only the highlights that I've already imported from Kindle so everything that I'm looking at I've already pred decided is valuable I'm really looking here for the best of the best the points that I can almost directly see how I'm going to incorporate them into my summary or into other projects that I have so let's start here at the top the argument of This Book Is that a series of shared properties and patterns recur again and Again in unusually fertile environments that's fantastic so anytime the author tells you the main argument of this book or the main message of this book that is worth a bold uh because they've sort of done the work for you of figuring out what the book is about ideas are works of brick collage they're built out of that detritus we take the ideas we've inherited or that we've stumbled across and we them together into some new shape that's a great sentence he's Sort of setting up this argument I think that Innovation doesn't come all at Once In This brilliant moment of Eureka Insight it comes from the slow development and the mixing and matching and recombination of different ideas which is an idea that I highly resonate with I'm going to continue now and bold the rest of the passages in the document that I found interesting and resonant so what I've done here in other words is distill I've distilled down Even the highlights that I had already selected from the book down into just the most important passages from those paragraphs step three turn the best of those points into an outline format I found that creating an outline with the major ideas and supporting points beneath them tells chat GPT which ideas to emphasize which ones are most important and which ones are merely supportive so here's how I'm going to do this I'll doubleclick the note here and Then I'll change the size of the window to only cover the left half of the screen then I will do command n to create a new note and move that to the right side of the screen this is my typical environment that I set up when I am translating one kind of information from uh the left to a different format on the right then I'll create a title which is simply outline for where good ideas come from book summary hit enter do shift command U to create a bullet Point and from this point forward I'm just going to really copy and paste each of the bolded passages I don't have to do all of them by any means in fact I shouldn't do all of them I should once again almost do another stage of deciding is this truly truly so good so valuable that it must be part of my summary so I'm going to do command C and copy that this seems like quite a good point to lead my summary with kind of the main argument of the book this is Clearly a supporting point for that one so often it's almost like you are reverse engineering you are extracting the structure that is already part of the book The that the author put there on purpose but you're extracting it from something that is kind of hidden and not very visible into something that is highly visible here on the right I'm going to continue on my own now adding the rest of these bolded points to my outline And step four dump that outline into chat GPT use a prompt like the one I showed you and you should be good to go I'm going to go ahead and click on the note and do select all and then command C for copy then I'm going to head over to chat GPT then click on the prompt window and I'm going to use the following prompt that I've developed which is so you don't want it to only use what You're providing you want it to add or incorporate what you're giving it into other material that it finds on the web right I didn't highlight every single good idea in the entire book I really highlighted the ones that were most important or interesting to me personally I will add another sentence here which is and the reason I do this is good writing is really all about details if you think about it what makes a piece of Writing really compelling it's not that that uses these poetic turns of phrase It's does it have interesting unique unusual details so I'll just add a colon couple spaces paste in that entire outline and then hit return I just can't believe by the way that I'm sitting here watching an artificial intelligence write what would have taken me many many hours of focus writing to do look at it this is fantastic we live in the future \[Music\] folks and there we go that was by far the fastest step which took about 30 seconds notice that this summary is far superior to the one that we got when we simply asked chat GPT to write a summary based on its own knowledge it's far longer it's far more detailed it's more specific it has way more supporting points supporting examples it's just a better summary on any Dimension that matters I saved at least 70 or 80% of The time it previously took me to summarize books if you read especially if you read books especially if you read books that have some kind of practical takeaway that you want to apply in your own life or your own work I really encourage you to give this a try it's never been easier or more efficient or more accessible to combine the incredible content that we now have access to via the Internet and books with the incredible capabilities of Artificial intelligence to create something that in the past would have taken 10 times as long I encourage you to give it a try and to share your ideas and your experiments and the results of those experiments with us in the \[Music\] comments  

我简直不敢相信，我坐在这里看着人工智能写出我需要花很多很多小时才能写出的东西，看看吧，我们生活在未来，如果你是新来的，你好，我叫蒂亚戈-福特，我是《构建第二个大脑》的作者，这本书的全部内容都在这里。 在本视频中，我将与您分享我所学到的如何有效使用聊天 GPT 来总结书籍的方法，然后我将通过一个创建书籍摘要的真实示例一步一步地教您，这样您就可以自己动手做了。 我曾经每年阅读 50 本书籍，像对待生命一样快速阅读，直到有一天我意识到这些都不是我正在阅读的内容。 我不知道你怎么想，但我希望我的阅读能真正改变我的生活，所以几年前，我决定开始减少阅读量，并用自己的话总结这些书，让知识真正融入我的生活。 忘掉我所学到的一切，我可以把这本有形的书摘集看作是我所学到的知识的证明 写书摘是非常耗时的，首先找到时间读一本书就已经很不容易了，还要再额外留出时间来写书摘，尤其是几年前我为人父母后，我突然就没有时间了，当聊天 GPT 出现时，我意识到这可能是创造我的书的一种方式 问题是，我们能否从聊天 GPT 中获得高质量的书籍摘要？一开始，我试着让聊天 GPT 自己写摘要，但尝试了多次后，我发现这些摘要并不好，它们过于简短肤浅，老生常谈，无法捕捉到书中最不寻常、最有见地的重要观点。 幸运的是，我可以访问全文，特别是我在阅读时突出显示电子书的内容，并使用名为 readwise 的服务，您可以在本视频中了解更多信息。 我决定在 iPad 上的 Kindle 应用程序中阅读史蒂文-约翰逊（Steven Johnson）的《好主意从何而来》一书，在阅读过程中，我突出显示了其中的精彩段落，所有这些段落都被自动保存到了我的数字笔记中。 问题是，大多数情况下，我从一本书中保存的重点内容都过于广泛，正如你在这里看到的，仅这一本书就有 8000 字，这大约是聊天 GPT 允许字数的两倍，所以我通常会发现，我需要做第一遍，只选择最重要的部分。 你在注释中看到的只是我已经从 Kindle 中导入的亮点，所以我所看到的一切都已经预先确定是有价值的，我在这里真正寻找的是精华中的精华，我几乎可以直接看到我要如何将它们纳入我的总结或其他项目中。 同样，在异常肥沃的环境中，这也是非常棒的，所以无论何时，作者告诉你这本书的主要论点或主要信息，都值得你大胆地呃，因为他们已经为你做了一些工作，让你搞清楚这本书是关于什么的，思想是砖块拼贴的作品，它们是由我们继承的或我们偶然发现的思想碎片堆砌而成的，我们将它们组合成某种新的形状，这是他的一个伟大的句子。 我认为，创新并不是一蹴而就的，它来自于缓慢的发展，以及不同想法的混合、匹配和重组。 第三步，将这些要点中的精华转化为大纲格式。我发现，创建一个大纲，将主要观点和辅助观点置于其下，可以告诉聊天 GPT 哪些观点需要强调，哪些是最重要的，哪些只是辅助观点。 然后，我将改变窗口的大小，使其只覆盖屏幕的左半部分，然后执行命令 n 创建一个新注释，并将其移动到屏幕右侧，这就是我在将一种信息从左侧转换为右侧的不同格式时所设置的典型环境。 从这一点出发，我将复制并粘贴每一个加粗段落，我不一定要全部复制，事实上，我不应该全部复制，我应该再做一个阶段的决定，即这一点是否真的如此之好，如此有价值，以至于它必须成为我的摘要的一部分，所以我将执行命令C，复制这一点，这似乎是一个很好的点，可以用这本书的主要论点来引导我的摘要，这是我的摘要的一部分。 很明显，这一点是一个支撑点，所以很多时候，它几乎就像你在逆向工程，你在提取已经是书的一部分的结构，作者故意放在那里，但你把它从一种隐藏的、不太明显的东西提取出来，变成一种非常明显的东西。 第四步，将大纲转入聊天 GPT，使用我向你展示过的提示符，这样就可以了。我将继续点击注释，然后全选，然后用 C 命令复制，然后我将前往聊天 GPT，然后点击提示窗口，我将使用我开发的以下提示符，这样你就不会希望它只使用什么了 我并没有强调整本书中的每一个好主意，我只是强调了那些对我个人来说最重要或最有趣的主意。 我简直不敢相信，我坐在这里看着人工智能写出了我需要花很多很多小时专注写作才能完成的东西，看看吧，这真是太棒了，我们生活在未来。 \[这是到目前为止最快的一步 花了大约30秒 注意到这份摘要比我们让聊天GPT 根据自己的知识写的摘要要好得多 如果你阅读的书籍，尤其是你阅读的书籍有某种实用的启示，你想将其应用到自己的生活或工作中，我真的鼓励你试一试，将我们现在可以通过互联网和书籍获得的令人难以置信的内容与令人难以置信的能力结合起来，从来没有像现在这样简单、高效或容易获得。 人工智能可以创造出过去需要十倍时间才能完成的东西，我鼓励你们试一试，并在【音乐】评论中与我们分享你们的想法、实验和实验结果。
