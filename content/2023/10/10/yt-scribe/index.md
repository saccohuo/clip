There's many kinds of notes that you want to exist but you don't have to create them that is exactly what read wise does this is a just mind-blowing Treasure Trove of knowledge this one folder called read wise why would I not save and preserve just the gems of insight the nuggets of wisdom that these sources contain I really fought I've pushed aside so many distractions I've dedicated and invested so much high Quality attention to consume these in the first place \[Music\] I don't usually recommend specific apps my attitude is generally that they're interchangeable but there is one product there is one platform called read wise that is different you can almost think of it like a second brain companion it is this critical almost piece of infrastructure that you can install into your second brain ecosystem that is so Powerful so valuable that it is more or less Irreplaceable there's many kinds of notes that you want to exist you want them to be created but you don't have to create them isn't this kind of the whole point of technology to save human effort so think about the kinds of notes that you'd like to exist that you can automate that you can have it happen in the background automatically with no effort or more importantly attention that thing you already have so little of Required from you you so think about the kind of most typical case which is your reading you read books you read online articles you read blog posts you read newspaper articles that kind of focused aware reading where you're not just reading a tweet or an Instagram caption you're actually taking the time and space to sit down and really think about something really take an idea seriously that is a rare and precious experience now what if as you were reading you Could highlight the best parts the most relevant Parts the most interesting Parts most unusual and surprising Parts the parts that resonate with you personally well you can't you're probably already familiar with this kind of feature whether it's on a Kindle device and you put down your finger and you just move it across a sentence or a paragraph what read wise can do is basically sense or detect when you've made such a highlight and within a few Minutes of you making that highlight it extracts just that piece of text no more no less just the part that you highlighted and it sends it exports it through the internet over to your note-taking app and it can actually do that to any one of a dozen or more different note-taking apps so you don't have to choose a specific note-taking app so that's half of what read wise does that's the first major use case you could call it highlight syncing finds Your highlights sends them to your notes out and I did that for years but in the past few years read wise has taken kind of The Next Step a very exciting step which is they have created what's called a read later app a read later app you can think of it like a digital reading list where do you put and where do you find all the things that you want to get to later that article that is so interesting but you don't have time to read it in the midst of your workday Even other kinds of content by the way not just text that YouTube video that is 30 minutes long or an hour long that demonstrates or teaches some very important thing you want to know but you don't have time in the midst of your busy week to watch that save it to your relator app it could be almost any online Resource as long as it has a specific URL a specific web address can be added to your relator app now why would you want to do that sounds kind of Simple and obvious you just compile a list of all the things you want to get to later but this little Act of just it's just one button it's actually a little plug-in in your browser that just says save as you go through your days and your weeks just hitting save on things what does that do the benefits of that tiny little effortless action are really incredibly profound one thing it does is it removes you from the distracting environment that is the Internet most of the internet if you think about it especially social media is not designed for calm deep purposeful reflection it's exactly the opposite right you may find a fascinating very in-depth piece of writing on social media but if you really want to create the focused reading environment that's necessary you have to take it out of that environment to a separate environment in this case a dedicated piece of software that is designed for That that is clean minimalistic there's zero ads 0 distractions you just put the content that you actually want to consume that you want to put into your mind in a place that supports that kind of consumption the other thing that that does is it gives you a chance to step away from a piece of content that you thought at the moment would be useful and relevant but often if you time shift it if you save it in the afternoon and Come back to it that evening the next day or days later or weeks later suddenly that little bit of time that has passed even if it's just a few hours suddenly gives you almost this sense of objectivity you're able to see it in a new light you're able to see it without the emotions and the feelings and the distractions of that moment and often the effect of that is you realize you don't actually want to consume it at all you actually gain wisdom about what is Relevant and important and what I find is I end up deleting never even looking at maybe half of the stuff that is saving my relater app and it's the half that is most click-baity most sensationalistic most pointless most full of hype that's the stuff that I don't even want to be filling my mind anyway let me show you what this actually looks like so I'm going to start by going to their website which is readwise dot IO the home page is Explanatory showing you and explaining how readwise works but once you've created an account you can go ahead and sign in once you sign in you'll see your dashboard your dashboard is the list of all the different things that read wise does and actually does a lot of things can be a little overwhelming to be honest but let me take you through just a couple of the features that I personally use the thing to pay Attention to here is the first section called connect and sync highlights this is the original way that I used this service and the most important way that I continue to use it today the terminology it uses is Import and Export all this is saying is where is the content coming from what is the source and then where is it going to where is the destination so import export Source destination reading and note taking so I'm going to go ahead and click import And what you see here is a pretty extensive page of the many many sources that read wise can import from okay I'm not going to go through all of these but some of these are podcast apps or book review apps annotation apps up here um our assess which is a reading format apps other read later apps such as insta paper and pocket you can also import from email from a CSV from PDFs all these different things so I'll leave this to you to play with I really only Use one which you'll see right up here which is Kindle I download pretty much all eBooks on the Kindle service mostly honestly because it connects to read wise that's how important this is so all I did is uh added Kindle as an import source and then it appeared up here at the top where it says connected and you can actually see that I need to click to reconnect so once in a while every few months or so for reasons I don't understand it goes out of connection This is actually a great opportunity because I'm going to show you what it looks like to sync Kindle with read was so I'm going to click right there it will ask me to sign in to my Amazon account and be sure to use the same Amazon account that you use to purchase the any books in the first place once you sign in to your Amazon account this is what you will see it's called your notes and highlights page this is actually a page that is generated for Any Amazon account you have one if you've ever read an Amazon Kindle ebook you can see the Kindle logo here in the corner and what it does is it gets all your notes which are little comments you've added using the note taking The annotation feature on Kindle and your highlights all the passages that you have designated by the way everything I'm showing you here also works both on Amazon Kindle devices like the actual devices they sell and it works on the Amazon Kindle app that app is free not just for Android but for iOS so so you can really read an Amazon Kindle book on virtually any mobile device and on your computer by the way so even if you don't have a mobile device or you don't want to read on a mobile device you can download the Kindle desktop app for Windows PC or Mac completely for free the ebooks won't be free but the software to read them incredibly is completely free so what am I looking at Here if you look on the left you'll see all the books that I've read on Kindle and you can probably see there's a lot there's hundreds so I can actually click on any book that I've read in the past here on the left and it will show me every one of the highlights I've made in this case this is the most recent book I've been reading I have 64 highlights so far you can see the passage I highlighted right here there's a Location which I could use to look it up in the book if I needed to or even easier I could click right here where it says options and open it directly to that page in the Kindle app so I can see it in context this only works if you have the Kindle app installed on your same device I can also add a note with my own thoughts or interpretations about this passage or simply delete the Highlight if I decide in retrospect it's not relevant now you Might be wondering at this point isn't this good enough isn't this what we're trying to find in the first place a compilation of all our different highlights yes and no yes in that Amazon has already done most of the work they've done a lot of work to surface all this information but this interface is actually very limited I can do a basic search but not more advanced searches I can't edit any of this I can't add bold underlining highlighting I can't really add my thoughts besides this little note thing which isn't very useful this is a read only it's a consumption format whereas notes really should be something interactive and as the book you see on screen indicates messy right so what we really need to do to get all those capabilities is to get this content into our Notes app now you could just copy and paste them I could just go here to the bottom click and drag actually no I really Can't so it's funny Amazon doesn't really make this easy they don't want you to remove this content they don't want you to take it anywhere because then you'd be less dependent on them it's never really very easy to use in this case it doesn't even really look like I'm able to select the text but even if I could you really don't want to do this manually if you do any kind of significant reading not just do you want to avoid you know all this meticulous Copying and pasting but sometimes if you're like me you start reading a book and then life gets busy or your interests shift so you put it aside and then come back to it later with read wise it will pick up where you left off and begin syncing new highlights even if months or years passes until you get back to that book so you don't have to remember and remind yourself oh I picked up that book again let me go back find the notes in my note-taking app go to The bottom and keep copying and pasting my notes like oh my God please do not subject yourself to that suffering what read wise is doing doing in this case is just automating that entire process so let me show you what this looks like for this one example okay so for the book messy the power of disorder to transform Our Lives which is kind of a funny a fun example for me to be using I'm just going to copy the title so that I can do a search for it and then we'll Head over to Evernote I'll go here to the search function actually let's see if I just type messy and then search everywhere there is the result messy by Tim Hartford so a couple things to notice this note was created completely automatically I've actually never opened this note the readwise service already got the title and the author put it in the title of this note and then each paragraph you see here is a highlight so For example each of these passages might come from very different parts of the book it separates them so you know that there's they're different by adding a paragraph separation right there the other thing to notice is the location so there's the number location 82 and you can also click this link and it will actually open within the Kindle app another thing to notice is see this date right here it says update it so what happened in this case is I started Reading the book probably for an hour or two and took all the highlights up to here and then I put it aside for a couple weeks and when I picked up again it automatically added this horizontal line as well as this date this is useful information it tells me okay I ended here and then I picked up reading right here and the cool thing they're really quite amazing thing is I can move this note right I can move it within para Maybe I have a project that it's related to or an area or resource in fact I want to move this note I should move this note to where it's going to be most useful and relevant in fact even if I change the title read-wise somehow still knows the note is there it knows how to find it and it will continue adding new highlights that you've taken no matter what you call the notes no matter what you change the title to and no matter where you move it so you're never going To get that broken link where you start making new highlights in an e-book and it has no idea how to find where that note went now if you look up here at the very top where is this note actually located now where does it begin where is it created in the first place it's in a notebook which is evernote's name for a folder called read wise so if I click on that this is the default folder where every single highlight that is imported by read wise goes so you can see this is A just mind-blowing Treasure Trove of knowledge I mean if I expand this out this goes all the way back to well it says 2018 but it actually goes back a lot further I think these dates were updated based on some syncing change but this is many many years this is probably over a decade of my high quality attention that I've spent reading you'll notice too that it's not just books for example this is a book called The Art of gathering but also Something we haven't even talked about yet which is articles so if you read an article such as this one and take a highlight which you can do in read wise's very own reading app called reader it will do the exact same thing it looks the same acts the same works the same with an online article as with an ebook so actually many of the items you see here such as this one and this one and this one and this one are actually imported from online articles Or in this case a tweet or it could be all sorts of different websites so we've looked at the import section let's also now look at the export so I'll click here you can see once again there's many options these are all the different places the the destinations that read wise can send your highlights to I personally use Evernote that's why it's up here in the connected section and they're adding more all the time so you can check back to see if you are not Taking app of choice is supported in the future so let me show you what this looks like I actually never have to do this it happens completely automatically but sometimes just to be sure it's working or just to see it working I like to click configure and you have a few options here I have the export automatically one checked so that I don't have to do this manually I also like to include highlight locations compact layout is always nice and I Don't want to select items to be exported I want to select all of them to be exported so if I click Start export to Evernote I'll need to log in once you've logged in you'll see this little spinning wheel and it says exported zero new highlights to zero notes if I had new highlights that it had not yet exported it would tell me right there and like I said the reason this these are both zero is that this happens automatically without my involvement so Everything that I've shown you so far which you could call connecting and syncing highlights it was the original the first kind of value add was to Simply get your your highlights from one place to another but there's a second major way that I use read wise which is much more recent let me now show you the read later app which is called reader that the company readwise launched a couple years ago here's what it looks like you can find It once you've created an account at read.readwise dot IO so this one has some more things that you need to understand reader is a reading list so not surprisingly it is presented in the form of a list there's a few different ways you can see the items you've saved you can see this home view you can see a feed which actually pulls in items that you're subscribed to such as newsletters automatically so you don't even have to save them but I actually like that step Of having to say yes I want to get to this later and hit save which means I like the traditional Library view there's also a few I can think of them as filters over here on the left sometimes you're in a certain kind of mood or you have a certain span of time or you just feel compelled to consume a particular format of content so this list you see currently is all different kinds of content from podcast episodes to tweets to New Yorker articles to YouTube videos but I can also filter by articles only buy books by emails by PDFs you can see I don't really read emails or PDFs here by tweets by videos you can also make a short list if you want to designate certain items as especially important or you can create custom views so this is one that I created with all audio so sometimes I don't really care what kind of audio it is like it could be a Spotify episode or a YouTube video or Even a tweet I'm not really designating what form of audio it is as long as it's audio it goes in the two listen to filter which is created by a tag that I created called to listen to I'll just show you one example if I click into this item which is an interview with Rick Rubin on his philosophy of creativity let's say I wanted to save this paragraph right here I could select it with my mouse and then it automatically gets highlighted I don't Even have to hit any button I could also add a note or tags but I don't bother with any of that I'm really just looking for the Highlight you can see I've just exported to Evernote manual and it exported one new highlight from one note well guess which one that is let's head over to Evernote and you can see here right at the top of my readwise folder is the title of the original Source the link where it came from and the exact passage that I highlighted I have over 300 folders in my Evernote account this is probably the most valuable this one folder called read wise and I think it's the most valuable because I've done the most work to find this knowledge right something that I wrote down some random idea I had you know while walking in the park walking the dog that has some value but I consider the many hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours that I've spent reading all these books and articles to be much more hard one much More hard fought I really fought I've pushed aside so many distractions I've dedicated and invested so much high quality attention to consume these in the first place why wouldn't I keep them why would I not save and preserve just the gems of insight the nuggets of wisdom that these sources contain so often when I'm looking for an answer to a question or a solution to a problem you know I want to know what Rick Rubin did in his career I want to know what Charles eisenstein thinks about you know that his philosophy of of eating I want to know how this family did over Landing in the Americas I want to know Kim Stanley Robinson's you know ideas on a future sci-fi scenario in which we terraform Mars I want to go back years and ask Daniel pink what he thinks about how to persuade people and sell them on things this is really like having a a mastermind a council of advisors of most of the greatest Minds that I've ever had Contact with all of which I can search I can annotate with my own thoughts I can incorporate and integrate into whatever I'm writing or creating or trying to think think about or decide on really read wise gives you almost the 80 20 value of an entire second brain with extremely small amount of effort and you can do it for you know a handful of dollars a month which I think is just one of the best ways to spend your money to make sure that you're capitalizing on The value of something far more valuable which is your attention \[Music\] foreign or you could delete the highlight what the heck is that breaking out a huge piece of furniture put it in this trash can it's typical Long Beach it comes from the author in some cases as well oh my God he has more furniture  

有许多类型的笔记，你想要存在，但你不必创建它们，这正是 read wise 所做的，这只是一个令人震惊的知识宝库，这一个名为 read wise 的文件夹，我为什么不保存和保留这些来源包含的洞察力的宝石和智慧的金块呢？ 我通常不推荐特定的应用程序，我的态度是它们可以互换，但有一个产品，有一个平台，叫做 "睿读"，它与众不同，你几乎可以把它想象成第二大脑的伴侣，它是一个至关重要的基础设施，你可以把它安装到你的第二大脑生态系统中，它是如此的重要，以至于你可以把它想象成第二大脑的伴侣，它是一个至关重要的基础设施，你可以把它安装到你的第二大脑生态系统中，它是如此的重要，以至于你可以把它想象成第二大脑的伴侣。 有许多种你希望存在的笔记，你希望它们被创建，但你不必创建它们，这不正是技术的全部意义吗？ 你阅读书籍，阅读网络文章，阅读博客文章，阅读报纸文章，这些都是最典型的阅读方式，你不仅仅是在阅读一条推文或 Instagram 上的标题，而是真正花时间和空间坐下来，认真思考一个问题，认真对待一个想法，这是一种难得而珍贵的体验。 你可能已经熟悉了这种功能，无论是在 Kindle 设备上，还是在阅读器上，你只需放下手指，然后在句子或段落中移动手指。 在你做出高亮显示的几分钟内，它就会提取出那段文字，不多不少，只是你高亮显示的部分，然后通过互联网将其导出到你的笔记应用中，实际上它可以将其导出到十几个不同笔记应用中的任何一个，所以你不必选择特定的笔记应用，这就是read wise的一半功能，也是你可以称之为高亮同步发现的第一个主要用例。 你可以把它想象成一个数字阅读列表，你可以把所有你想稍后读到的东西放在哪里，你可以在哪里找到那篇有趣的文章，但你没有时间在工作日中阅读它。 顺便说一下，即使是其他类型的内容，也不仅仅是文字，YouTube 上长达 30 分钟或一个小时的视频，演示或教授了一些您想知道的非常重要的东西，但您在一周的繁忙工作中却没有时间观看，将其保存到您的 relator 应用程序中，它几乎可以是任何在线资源，只要它有一个特定的 URL，一个特定的网址，就可以添加到您的 relator 应用程序中。 简单明了，你只需编制一份清单，列出所有你想稍后处理的事情，但这个小动作只是一个按钮，实际上是浏览器中的一个小插件，上面写着保存，当你度过每一天和每一周，只需点击保存即可。 你可能会在社交媒体上发现一篇非常有深度的文章，但如果你真的想创造一个必要的专注阅读环境，你就必须把它从那个环境中转移到一个独立的环境中，在这种情况下，一个专门的软件就是为这个目的设计的。 此外，它还能让你有机会从你认为有用且相关的内容中抽离出来，但如果你将其保存在下午，并进行了时间转移，那么这些内容往往会成为你的 "新宠"。 当天晚上、第二天、几天后或几周后，再回过头来看它，突然间，那一点点时间过去了，哪怕只是几个小时，也会让你有一种客观的感觉，你能够以一种新的眼光来看待它，你能够不受当时的情绪、感觉和干扰来看待它，而这样做的效果往往是，你会意识到你实际上根本不想消费它，你实际上获得了关于什么是它的智慧。 我发现，我最终删除的内容中，可能有一半保存在我的相关应用程序中，我甚至从来没有看过，而这一半的内容都是点击率最高的，最煽情的，最无意义的，最充满炒作的。 解释性说明向您展示并解释了读慧如何工作，但是一旦您创建了一个账户，您就可以继续前进并登录，一旦您登录，您就会看到您的仪表板，您的仪表板是读慧所做的所有不同事情的列表，实际上做了很多事情，老实说可能有点压倒性，但让我带您通过只是一对夫妇的功能，我个人使用的东西来支付 请注意，这里是第一部分，叫做连接和同步亮点，这是我使用这项服务的最初方式，也是我今天继续使用它的最重要方式，它使用的术语是 "导入和导出"。 你在这里看到的是一个非常广泛的页面，其中包含了很多智读可以导入的来源，好吧，我不打算一一介绍，但其中有些是播客应用或书评应用，还有一些是注释应用，比如我们的评估，这是一个阅读格式应用，其他的稍后阅读应用，如 insta paper 和 pocket，你还可以从电子邮件、CSV、PDF 等导入所有这些不同的内容，所以我就把这个留给你来玩吧，我真的只想让你知道，智读可以从哪些来源导入。 我在 Kindle 服务上下载了几乎所有的电子书，老实说，主要是因为它能连接阅读，这一点非常重要，所以我所做的就是添加 Kindle 作为导入源，然后它就会出现在顶部，上面写着已连接，实际上你可以看到我需要点击重新连接，所以每隔几个月或更长时间就会断开一次连接，原因我也不清楚。 这实际上是一个很好的机会，因为我将向你展示同步 Kindle 与阅读是什么样子的，所以我要点击那里，它会要求我登录到我的亚马逊帐户，并确保使用相同的亚马逊帐户，您使用购买任何书籍摆在首位，一旦你登录到您的亚马逊帐户，这是你会看到什么，这就是所谓的你的笔记和亮点页面，这实际上是一个页面，生成为 如果你有亚马逊账户，如果你曾经读过亚马逊 Kindle 电子书，你可以看到角落里的 Kindle 徽标，它的作用是获取你的所有笔记，这些笔记是你使用笔记功能添加的小注释 Kindle 上的注释功能和你指定的所有突出显示段落。 亚马逊 Kindle 应用程序是免费的，不仅适用于 Android，也适用于 iOS，因此您几乎可以在任何移动设备和电脑上阅读亚马逊 Kindle 电子书，即使您没有移动设备或不想在移动设备上阅读，也可以免费下载 Windows PC 或 Mac 的 Kindle 桌面应用程序。 在这里，如果你看左边，你会看到我在 Kindle 上读过的所有书，你可能会看到有很多，有数百本，所以我实际上可以点击左边我过去读过的任何一本书，它会显示我做的每一个亮点，在这种情况下，这是我最近读过的一本书，到目前为止，我有 64 个亮点，你可以看到我突出显示的段落，就在这里，有一个亮点。 如果需要，我可以用它在书中查找，或者更简单，我可以点击这里写着选项的地方，直接打开 Kindle 应用程序中的该页面，这样我就可以在上下文中看到它。 我可以进行基本搜索，但不能进行更高级的搜索，我不能编辑任何内容，我不能添加粗体下划线高亮显示。 除了这个小纸条之外，我真的无法添加我的想法，这不是很有用，这是一个只读，它是一个消费格式，而笔记真的应该是一些互动的东西，就像你在屏幕上看到的那本书所显示的乱七八糟的权利，所以我们真正需要做的是获得所有这些功能，是让这些内容到我们的笔记应用程序，现在你可以只是复制和粘贴它们，我可以只是去这里的底部点击和拖动实际上没有我真的 他们不希望你删除这些内容，他们不希望你把这些内容带到任何地方，因为这样你对他们的依赖性就会降低，在这种情况下，使用起来并不容易，甚至看起来我都无法选择文本，但即使我可以，如果你进行任何形式的重要阅读，你真的不想手动这样做，而不仅仅是想避免你知道的所有这些细致的操作。 复制和粘贴，但有时，如果你像我一样，开始读一本书，然后生活变得忙碌或你的兴趣转移，所以你把它放在一边，然后以后再回来读，睿智阅读会从你离开的地方开始，并开始同步新的亮点，即使几个月或几年过去了，直到你回到那本书，所以你不必记得和提醒自己哦，我又拿起那本书，让我回去找到我的笔记应用程序中的笔记转到 底部，并不断复制和粘贴我的笔记，就像哦，我的上帝，请不要让自己遭受这种痛苦。 在这种情况下，read wise 所做的只是自动执行整个过程，所以让我来告诉你这个例子看起来像什么。 前往 Evernote，我将在这里进入搜索功能，实际上，让我们看看，如果我输入 messy，然后到处搜索，就会出现 Tim Hartford 所写的 messy 结果，所以有几件事要注意：这篇笔记是完全自动创建的，我实际上从未打开过这篇笔记，Readwise 服务已经获取了标题，作者将其放在了这篇笔记的标题中，然后你在这里看到的每个段落都是高亮显示，所以 例如，这些段落可能来自书中非常不同的部分，它将它们分开，这样你就知道它们是不同的，在这里添加了一个段落分隔符。另一件要注意的事情是位置，所以有数字位置 82，你也可以点击这个链接，它实际上将在 Kindle 应用程序中打开。 我大概读了一两个小时的书，把所有的重点都记到了这里，然后我把它放在一边几个星期，当我再次拿起它的时候，它会自动添加这条横线以及这个日期，这是有用的信息，它会告诉我，好吧，我在这里结束了，然后我在这里重新开始阅读。 也许我有一个与之相关的项目，或者一个领域或资源，事实上，我想移动这个笔记，我应该把这个笔记移动到它最有用和最相关的地方，事实上，即使我改变了标题，从阅读的角度来看，不知何故，它仍然知道这个笔记在那里，它知道如何找到它，它会继续添加你所做的新的亮点，无论你把笔记叫做什么，无论你把标题改成什么，无论你把它移动到哪里，所以你永远不会去 如果你想在电子书中创建新的高亮显示，但却不知道该如何找到该笔记的位置，那么你可以从最顶端往上看，这个笔记究竟位于哪里？ 我是说，如果我把这个扩展开来，它可以一直追溯到2018年，但实际上它可以追溯到更早的时候，我想这些日期是根据一些同步变化更新的，但这已经是很多很多年的事情了，这可能是我花在阅读上的十多年的高质量关注。 所以，如果你读了一篇文章，比如这篇文章，并将其高亮显示出来，你可以在睿读自己的阅读应用程序 "reader "中这样做，它会做完全相同的事情，看起来一样，做起来一样，在线文章和电子书的效果也是一样的。 我们已经看过了导入部分，现在让我们看看导出部分，所以我点击这里，你可以再次看到有很多选项，这些是所有不同的地方，睿读可以将你的亮点发送到的目的地。 实际上，我从来都不需要这样做，它完全是自动进行的，但有时为了确保它能正常工作，或者只是想看看它的工作情况，我喜欢点击配置，这里有几个选项，我选中了自动导出，这样就不需要手动操作了。 我不想选择要导出的项目，我想选择要导出的所有项目，所以如果我点击 "开始导出到 Evernote"，我就需要登录，一旦你登录，你就会看到这个小转盘，上面写着 "导出了零个新要点到零个笔记"，如果我有新要点还没有导出，它就会在那里告诉我，就像我说的，之所以这些都是零，是因为这是在没有我参与的情况下自动发生的，所以我点击 "开始导出到 Evernote"，你就会看到这个小转盘，上面写着 "导出了零个新要点到零个笔记"。 到目前为止，我向您展示的所有内容都可以称为连接和同步亮点，这是最初的第一种增值功能，可以简单地将您的亮点从一个地方传输到另一个地方，但我使用读慧的第二种主要方式则更为新颖，现在让我向您展示读慧公司几年前推出的稍后阅读应用程序，它被称为阅读器。 一旦你在 read.readwise dot IO 创建了账户，你就会发现阅读器是一个阅读列表，所以它以列表的形式呈现也就不足为奇了。你可以通过几种不同的方式查看你保存的项目，你可以看到主页视图，你可以看到一个 feed，它实际上是自动拉入你订阅的项目，例如新闻简报，所以你甚至不必保存它们，但实际上我喜欢这一步。 这意味着我喜欢传统的 "图书馆 "视图，我还可以把它们看作是左侧的过滤器，有时你会有某种情绪，或者你有一定的时间跨度，或者你只是觉得必须消费某种特定格式的内容，所以你目前看到的这个列表包含了所有不同类型的内容，从播客剧集到推文，再到《纽约客》的文章，等等。 YouTube 视频，但我也可以按文章（只购买书籍）按电子邮件按 PDF 过滤，你可以看到我并不阅读电子邮件或 PDF，这里是按推文按视频过滤，如果你想将某些项目指定为特别重要的项目，你还可以制作一个简短列表，或者创建自定义视图，这是我创建的一个包含所有音频的视图，所以有时我并不关心它是哪种音频，比如它可能是 Spotify 的一集或 YouTube 视频或其他音频。 即使是一条推文，我也不会指定它是什么形式的音频，只要它是音频，就会进入 "两听 "过滤器，这个过滤器是由我创建的一个名为 "听 "的标签创建的，我只想给你举个例子，如果我点击这个项目，这是 Rick Rubin 关于他的创作哲学的访谈，假设我想保存这段话，我可以用鼠标选中它，然后它就会自动高亮显示，我不需要这样做。 我还可以添加注释或标签，但我不会理会这些，我只想找到 "突出显示"，你可以看到我刚刚导出到 Evernote 手册，它从一个注释中导出了一个新的突出显示，猜猜是哪一个，让我们前往 Evernote，你可以看到在我的 readwise 文件夹的顶部，有原始源文件的标题、源文件的链接以及我突出显示的确切段落。 在我的Evernote账户里有300个文件夹，这可能是最有价值的一个，这个文件夹叫做 "睿智阅读"，我认为它是最有价值的，因为我做了最多的工作来找到这些知识，我写下的一些随意的想法，你知道，当我走在公园里遛狗的时候，这些想法有一定的价值，但我认为我花了成百上千个小时来阅读所有这些书籍和文章，这是更难得的。 我已经抛开了太多的杂念，投入了太多的注意力来消费这些东西，为什么我不保留它们呢？为什么我不保存和保留这些来源所包含的洞察力的宝石和智慧的金块呢？
