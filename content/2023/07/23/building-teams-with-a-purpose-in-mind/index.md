Building teams is always an interesting challenge. You can’t just put Senior people from different backgrounds and mindsets together and expect that everything will work out. You need to have people in the team that complement each other and have the right mindset.  

组建团队始终是一项有趣的挑战。你不能把来自不同背景和思维方式的资深人士放在一起，然后期望一切都能顺利进行。团队中必须有互补性强、心态正确的人。

It’s important to understand that one person can thrive in one type of team, but can ultimately be miserable in another team. That’s why we need to build teams with purpose in mind.  

重要的是要明白，一个人可以在一种类型的团队中茁壮成长，但在另一种团队中却可能最终痛苦不堪。这就是为什么我们需要以目标为导向建立团队。

Let’s start with the overview of different options.  

让我们先来了解一下不同选项的概况。

There are many different types of teams, especially in larger companies, some are a lot more operational and plan their work based on requests. Others are a lot more autonomous and work to build the best possible solutions for our customers.  

团队有很多种类型，尤其是在大公司，有些团队更注重运营，根据要求规划工作。其他团队则更加自主，致力于为客户打造最佳解决方案。

In this article, we are focusing on teams that are either fully engineering teams or they are cross-functional and contain engineers.  

在本文中，我们将重点讨论完全由工程人员组成的团队，或者包含工程师的跨职能团队。

Some of the different types of teams are:  

不同类型的团队包括

-   Product Teams 产品团队
    

Teams that are working on new product iterations.  

正在进行新产品迭代的团队。

-   Growth Engineering Teams 增长工程团队
    

Teams that are supporting marketing activities e.g. adding new functionality on the website, implementing SEO improvements, preparing landing pages, etc.  

支持营销活动的团队，如在网站上添加新功能、实施搜索引擎优化改进、准备登陆页面等。

-   QA Teams 质量保证团队
    

Teams that are ensuring the quality of a product or a service via manual or automation testing.  

通过手动或自动化测试确保产品或服务质量的团队。

-   Platform Teams 平台团队
    

Teams that are supporting other teams and are not directly involved in customer-facing functionalities.  

支持其他团队的团队，不直接参与面向客户的功能。

There are a lot more types of teams, but these are the most widely used ones. It’s important to understand that every team has a different purpose and you need people with different mindsets in their respective teams.  

团队的类型还有很多，但这些都是使用最广泛的类型。重要的是要明白，每个团队都有不同的目的，你需要在各自团队中拥有不同思维方式的人。

Product teams are the most widely known teams and ultimately the most used. Those are the teams that build new product iterations. These teams have one goal and should always have in mind one important thing:  

产品团队是最广为人知的团队，也是使用最多的团队。这些团队负责构建新的产品迭代。这些团队的目标只有一个，并应始终牢记一件重要的事情：

-   Delighting the customers (users) is our #1 purpose.  
    
    让客户（用户）满意是我们的首要目标。
    

These teams should be cross-functional and should contain all of the different types of experts to support new iterations. Normally they are constructed with a Product Manager (PM), Designer (UI/UX), Engineers, QA Engineer, and any other function needed.  

这些团队应该是跨职能的，应该包含所有不同类型的专家，以支持新的迭代。通常，这些团队由产品经理 (PM)、设计师（用户界面/用户体验）、工程师、质量保证工程师和其他所需的职能人员组成。

Knowing that the goal is to delight our customers. We should bring in people that are focused on this goal. Let’s take a look at specifics types:  

我们的目标是让客户满意。我们应该引进专注于这一目标的人才。让我们来看看具体类型：

-   Engineers that are very much interested in understanding the product, the industry, and the business. These types of engineers normally do very well in the team.  
    
    对了解产品、行业和业务非常感兴趣的工程师。这类工程师通常在团队中表现出色。
    
-   QA Engineer that is not only focused on finding bugs and ensuring quality, but they focus a lot on ensuring that the team is building the right things by challenging requirements through their understanding of details.  
    
    质量保证工程师不仅要专注于查找错误和确保质量，还要通过对细节的理解来挑战需求，从而确保团队正在构建正确的东西。
    
-   The same goes for all other functions. PM should always strive to get feedback from customers and see what we can do to improve the overall satisfaction of the product. And a Designer should always collaborate with engineers and PM to try to design experiences that would be easy to use.  
    
    所有其他功能也是如此。项目管理应始终努力从客户那里获得反馈，看看我们能做些什么来提高产品的整体满意度。设计师应始终与工程师和项目管理人员合作，努力设计出易于使用的体验。
    

Growth Engineering teams can be also called Marketing Engineering teams. Those are the teams that are supporting growth/marketing activities. This can include a new feature on the website, adjusting the website for SEO purposes, building a landing page, etc. The goal of these teams is to:  

增长工程团队也可称为营销工程团队。这些团队为增长/营销活动提供支持。这可能包括网站上的新功能、为搜索引擎优化调整网站、建立登陆页面等。这些团队的目标是

-   Provide as much growth to the company as possible.  
    
    为公司带来尽可能多的增长。
    

This could either be via more users/customers or getting more visibility, which ultimately leads to more users/customers.  

这可能是通过更多的用户/客户或获得更高的知名度，最终带来更多的用户/客户。

This kind of team is also a cross-functional team that consists of Engineers, a PM, a Designer (Marketing), and potentially also a QA as well + others. It’s a lot more operational than a Product team.  

这种团队也是一个跨职能团队，由工程师、项目经理、设计师（市场营销）以及可能的质量保证和其他人员组成。它比产品团队更具操作性。

Growth and Marketing require teams that are a lot more receptive to changes, therefore the team should not have 2-week sprints closely defined and expect that nothing will change.  

增长和营销要求团队更容易接受变化，因此团队不应该严格规定 2 周的冲刺时间，并期望不会有任何变化。

There is a lot of A/B testing for this team and prototyping to see what works and what does not. If something doesn’t work, we need to move fast and adjust it.  

这个团队需要进行大量的 A/B 测试和原型设计，以确定哪些有效，哪些无效。如果有些东西不起作用，我们需要快速行动并进行调整。

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F624834de-b667-4e78-a4f8-b4965e19982c_800x327.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F624834de-b667-4e78-a4f8-b4965e19982c_800x327.jpeg)

Knowing that. We need people in the team that are perfectly fine if requirements are changing very frequently and they thrive in an environment where there are constantly new ideas and prototypes being developed.  

知道这一点。我们的团队需要这样的人才：如果需求经常变化，他们完全可以胜任；如果不断有新的想法和原型被开发出来，他们也能在这样的环境中茁壮成长。

If we can find the right word for it. That would be that people need to have the “hustle” mentality. Always trying out different things and seeing what works and what does not.  

如果我们能找到一个合适的词来形容它的话。那就是人们需要有 "喧嚣 "的心态。不断尝试不同的事物，看看哪些可行，哪些不可行。

It’s a very fun and proactive team to be a part of, but if a particular person is valuing a lot more stability and clear requirements, that should not be a team for them.  

这是一个非常有趣、积极主动的团队，但如果某个人更看重稳定性和明确的要求，那么这个团队就不适合他。

I am normally a big advocate for having a QA directly as part of the Product/Growth/Platform teams and the reason for that is that a dedicated QA can help the team a lot more than a QA team which is playing a support role.  

我通常非常主张将质量保证直接作为产品/成长/平台团队的一部分，原因是专门的质量保证对团队的帮助要远远大于起支持作用的质量保证团队。

A lot of companies have QA teams separately and this is for those that do have.  

很多公司都有单独的质量保证团队，这是为那些有质量保证团队的公司准备的。

When building QA teams it’s important to understand that their goal and mindset is to:  

在组建质量保证团队时，重要的是要明白他们的目标和心态是：

-   Ensure that the quality matches the company's goals.  
    
    确保质量符合公司目标。
    

These teams are filled with QA Engineers and the mindset of team members should always be on how to achieve the right level of quality.  

这些团队由质量保证工程师组成，团队成员的思维应始终围绕如何实现正确的质量水平。

This could either be by creating better test cases, improving the manual testing process, or adding/adjusting automation tests.  

这可以通过创建更好的测试用例、改进手动测试流程或添加/调整自动化测试来实现。

People that work best in these teams are very detail oriented and very thorough and diligent. They thrive in structure and defined processes and they enjoy environments with strict rules.  

在这些团队中工作得最好的人都非常注重细节，非常全面和勤奋。他们在结构和明确的流程中茁壮成长，喜欢有严格规定的环境。

When building QA Teams it’s really important to bring people in with that mindset. People that are a lot less structured, and focused and tend to wander their minds to different places, will not do well in these teams.  

在建立质量保证团队时，以这种思维模式引入人员非常重要。结构不严谨、注意力不集中、容易胡思乱想的人在这些团队中不会有好的表现。

Platform teams are teams that support other teams (normally product teams). This could either be with creating a certain API, creating tools, creating reusable components, or preparing stable pipelines.  

平台团队是为其他团队（通常是产品团队）提供支持的团队。这可以是创建某个应用程序接口、创建工具、创建可重复使用的组件，也可以是准备稳定的管道。

A good example is the DevOps team. They are very operational and are working on requests from others and they also have their initiatives. They ensure that the overall CI/CD process is stable and optimized so teams can deliver as fast as possible. Providing tools for teams to be autonomous should always be on their mind.  

DevOps 团队就是一个很好的例子。他们的工作非常具有操作性，既要处理他人提出的请求，也有自己的计划。他们要确保整个 CI/CD 流程的稳定和优化，以便团队能够尽快交付。为团队提供自主工具应始终是他们考虑的问题。

Therefore the goal and the mindset of these teams is to:  

因此，这些团队的目标和心态是：

-   Ensure to support other teams in the best way possible.  
    
    确保以最佳方式支持其他团队。
    

Platform teams can contain a wide variety of functions. They could be all engineering, like for example DevOps teams, or they can be purely Backend teams with a PM. If the team is building reusable UI components, they need engineers, a PM, and a Designer as well.  

平台团队可以包含多种职能。它们可以全部是工程团队，例如 DevOps 团队，也可以是纯粹的后端团队，并配备一名项目管理人员。如果团队正在构建可重用的用户界面组件，那么他们还需要工程师、项目经理和设计师。

People that are very helpful and supportive thrive in these teams. They have their eyes open if any team has a potential issue and they try to solve it even before that team knows about it. They love to build reusable systems and are looking for ways to multiply the efforts of other teams.  

乐于助人和提供支持的人在这些团队中茁壮成长。如果哪个团队有潜在问题，他们会睁大眼睛，甚至在该团队知道之前就设法解决。他们喜欢构建可重复使用的系统，并想方设法倍增其他团队的努力。

A person that has either maintained an open source library or has been part of communities that do, normally does well. A person that is a lot more customer and user-focused can feel like, they are not fulfilling their purpose.  

维护过开放源代码库或参加过开放源代码库社区的人，通常会做得很好。如果一个人更多地以客户和用户为中心，就会觉得自己没有达到目的。

It takes effort and experience in building teams that work well and are considered high-performing. Always keep in mind of what is the goal and what is the general purpose of the team. The team will function a lot better when contains people that fit right into that purpose.  

要建立一支工作出色、表现出色的团队，需要付出努力和积累经验。要始终牢记团队的目标和总体宗旨是什么。如果团队中的每个人都能与目标相匹配，那么团队就能更好地发挥作用。
