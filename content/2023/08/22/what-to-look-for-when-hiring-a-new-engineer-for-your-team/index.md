No great software is developed and maintained without great people. Engineering is a lot more about people than it is to focus just on technology.  

没有优秀的人才，就没有优秀软件的开发和维护。与只关注技术相比，工程设计与人的关系更为密切。

And to take it further. Only great teams develop great software. Therefore everyone contributes their best efforts and works together to achieve goals as a team. This is what engineering is.  

更进一步说只有优秀的团队才能开发出优秀的软件。因此，每个人都要尽自己最大的努力，作为一个团队，共同实现目标。这就是工程学。

In this article, we will go step by step on how to ensure you hire the right people for your team! It all starts, with creating a great environment, where people can thrive in.  

在本文中，我们将逐步介绍如何确保为团队招聘到合适的人才！这一切都始于创造一个良好的环境，让员工在其中茁壮成长。

You can’t hire great people if you don’t already have a great environment in place. Let me elaborate on that. You may get great people on board, but they will not nearly be close to their potential if you don’t place them in the position to be successful.  

如果没有一个良好的环境，你就不可能聘用到优秀的人才。让我详细说明一下。你可能会招聘到优秀的人才，但如果你没有为他们创造成功的环境，他们的潜力就无法发挥出来。

If you are an engineering leader, you need to do everything you can to do that. Some great ways to achieve that is to:  

如果你是一名工程领导者，你需要竭尽全力做到这一点。实现这一目标的一些好方法是：

-   Assign clear ownership and responsibility.  
    
    明确所有权和责任。
    
-   Empower people and teams so they can make decisions themselves.  
    
    赋予员工和团队权力，让他们自己做出决定。
    
-   Expose business problems to engineers instead of assigning tasks.  
    
    将业务问题暴露给工程师，而不是分配任务。
    
-   Always look for ways to offer growth opportunities to your team. Managers should be discussing career goals with their reports on every 1:1 meeting.  
    
    总是想方设法为团队提供成长机会。管理人员应在每次 1:1 会议上与下属讨论职业目标。
    
-   Focus on coaching and mentoring as one of the most important things.  
    
    把辅导和指导作为最重要的事情之一。
    
-   Create a smooth onboarding process and constantly improve it.  
    
    创建流畅的入职流程，并不断加以改进。
    
-   Ensure developer experience is great (tooling, equipment, guidelines, alignment between teams).  
    
    确保开发人员获得良好的体验（工具、设备、指导原则、团队之间的协调）。
    
-   Always keep on improving the overall environment - it’s especially important to listen to feedback from people.  
    
    始终坚持改善整体环境--听取人们的反馈意见尤为重要。

Before you even start the hiring process it’s really important to fully understand what you are looking for. This is where creating a detailed job brief is very important.  

在开始招聘流程之前，充分了解您正在寻找的职位非常重要。因此，制定一份详细的职位简介非常重要。

If you don’t have it yet, you can find my [Notion Template: Job Brief here](https://gregorojstersek.gumroad.com/l/notion-template-job-brief?layout=profile). This is exactly the template that I use for hiring great engineers.  

如果您还没有，可以在这里找到我的 "概念模板"：在这里找到 Job Brief。这正是我用来招聘优秀工程师的模板。

Make sure to fill in all of the details including the business need for the role. That’s very important because you don’t want to fill the role just for the sake of filling it. If it makes sense for the business, it makes sense for you as well.  

确保填写所有细节，包括该职位的业务需求。这一点非常重要，因为你不想为了填补职位而填补职位。如果这对企业有意义，对你也有意义。

Now that we have a great environment and we fully understand what needs we have for a certain role, it’s important to understand what traits to focus on.  

既然我们已经有了一个很好的环境，也充分了解了我们对某个角色的需求，那么了解应该关注哪些特质就非常重要了。

During my career, I had the pleasure to interview more than 300 engineers.  

在我的职业生涯中，我有幸采访过 300 多位工程师。

Throughout my experience, I came across an important finding that always stood out with engineers that were successful in the role after they joined the team.  

在我的工作经历中，我发现了一个重要的发现，那就是那些加入团队后在工作中取得成功的工程师总是很突出。

They were all great engineers, but what made them great was not just their technical expertise, but their soft skills.  

他们都是伟大的工程师，但他们之所以伟大，不仅在于他们的技术专长，还在于他们的软技能。

When I’m interviewing a new engineer I value soft skills more than technical expertise.  

在面试新工程师时，我更看重软技能，而不是技术专长。

Unless I’m hiring for a strict expert in a particular technology, I normally look for engineers that can reasonably articulate things and can demonstrate drive, motivation for learning, as well as being a good team player.  

除非我招聘的是某项技术的专家，否则我通常会找那些能合理表达事情、有动力、有学习动机、有团队合作精神的工程师。

The reason for this, as said above is that teams build great software, not individuals.  

其原因正如上文所说，是团队而不是个人打造了优秀的软件。

I am a big believer in hiring people that can make others around them better, not just focus on their individual contribution.  

我非常相信，聘用的人要能让周围的人变得更好，而不是只关注他们的个人贡献。

If everyone makes everyone around them better, we are all exponentially growing. There is no better environment to be in when everyone is always there to help and support you.  

如果每个人都能让身边的人变得更好，那么我们都会成倍地成长。当每个人都在帮助和支持你时，没有比这更好的环境了。

This can either be a technical interview, behavioral, or a hiring manager interview. In any of these interviews, there are specific signs, of how you can spot these traits in candidates. Here are a few practical examples of how I spot them.  

这可以是技术面试、行为面试，也可以是招聘经理面试。在任何一种面试中，你都可以通过一些特定的迹象来发现求职者的这些特质。以下是我如何发现这些特质的几个实际例子。

-   The candidate reasonably articulates things.  
    
    候选人合理地阐述了事情。
    

They are not pretending to be an expert in something that they are not. They are not afraid to say that they don’t know something if they don’t know. They are not trying to “wing” answers and hope they are right. They have a full overview of the scope of the current or past project, their responsibilities, the roles, what business need the project is solving, etc. They are not just focused on what they have been doing but focused also on the success of the whole team.  

他们不会假装自己是某方面的专家。如果他们不知道什么，他们不会害怕说自己不知道。他们不会 "自以为是"，希望自己的答案是正确的。他们对当前或过去项目的范围、他们的职责、角色、项目要解决的业务需求等有全面的了解。他们不仅关注自己的工作，还关注整个团队的成功。

I can spot this best when talking about a past project they have worked on, what was their role, how they have contributed to the success and how have they helped others. To get all the information needed, I ask a lot of sub-questions.  

在谈到他们过去参与的一个项目时，我最能发现这一点，即他们的角色是什么，他们是如何为项目的成功做出贡献的，以及他们是如何帮助他人的。为了获得所需的全部信息，我会问很多小问题。

-   The candidate demonstrates motivation and drive for learning.  
    
    候选人表现出学习的积极性和动力。
    

The question I like to ask is “What new have you learned in the past 6 months?”.  

我喜欢问的问题是："在过去 6 个月里，你学到了什么新知识？

I like to look at the way the candidate is answering and also observe their non-verbal communication. If they sound very excited, they provide details, they are smiling, or they use their hands a lot when answering. These are all signs that they love what they are doing and learning new things is something they like to do.  

我喜欢看应聘者的回答方式，也喜欢观察他们的非语言交流。如果他们听起来非常兴奋，提供细节，面带微笑，或者回答问题时经常用手。这些都表明他们热爱自己的工作，学习新事物是他们喜欢做的事情。

-   The candidate is a team player.  
    
    候选人具有团队合作精神。
    

Again, both verbal and non-verbal communication are important here. When the candidate is speaking about helping others, onboarding, focusing on team goals, sharing knowledge, etc. Same as above, I mainly look for excitement. If the way they speak about it reminds you of “I didn’t want to help others, but I needed to”, it’s probably not the right fit.  

同样，语言和非语言沟通在这里都很重要。当候选人谈到帮助他人、入职、关注团队目标、分享知识等时。和上面一样，我主要看他们是否兴奋。如果他们谈论此事的方式让你联想到 "我并不想帮助他人，但我需要这样做"，那么这可能并不合适。

Also, it’s important that the candidate provides examples of how they contributed the success of a project, not only provide examples of their work. This can be asked as a standalone question, or when talking about a specific project they were part of in the past.  

此外，重要的是应聘者要举例说明他们是如何为项目的成功做出贡献的，而不仅仅是举例说明他们的工作。这个问题可以单独提出，也可以在谈到他们过去参与的某个具体项目时提出。

We have defined all of the steps that you should take to hire engineers with the right traits for your team. It all starts with creating a great environment, continues with defining all of the needs for the role, and lastly, make sure to focus and spot the right traits on interviews.  

我们已经为您定义了为团队招聘具有合适特质的工程师所应采取的所有步骤。这一切都始于创造一个良好的环境，继而确定角色的所有需求，最后，确保在面试中关注并发现正确的特质。
