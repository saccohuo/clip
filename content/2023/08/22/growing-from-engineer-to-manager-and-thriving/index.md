This edition is a continuation of the previous “Which is the right engineering career path for you?”. We are moving more towards the mindset and mentality needed to grow and thrive as a manager.  

本期是上一期 "哪条才是适合你的工程职业道路？我们将更多地探讨作为管理者成长和茁壮成长所需的思维方式和心态。

Remember, when growing from an engineer to a manager it’s important to understand that you need a totally different set of skills and mindset. You are not judged by your own contribution anymore but by the contribution of the whole team.  

请记住，当你从工程师成长为经理时，必须明白你需要一套完全不同的技能和心态。评判你的标准不再是你自己的贡献，而是整个团队的贡献。

I’ve had the pleasure to interview Nicola Ballota. He is a Director of Cloud at Namecheap, leading 4 teams with a combined 35 people. We talked about his experience and his path in growing, how to find a good fit for the manager role, steps to take as an engineer to become a manager, recommendations for new managers, and how to keep improving your knowledge overall as a manager.  

我有幸采访了 Nicola Ballota。他是 Namecheap 的云总监，领导着 4 个团队共 35 人。我们谈论了他的经历和成长之路、如何找到适合经理角色的人选、作为工程师成为经理的步骤、对新经理的建议，以及作为经理如何不断提高自己的综合知识。

What does it take to grow and thrive as a manager? Let’s find out.  

作为一名管理者，如何才能成长和茁壮成长？让我们一探究竟。

I learned most things through direct experience and only later in my career started studying and receiving coaching. Since I was young I spent a lot of time growing my technical knowledge, which aligned with my main passion. After some IC roles, I founded a couple of companies where I began building and leading small teams. This is where my entrepreneurial mindset emerged, and my interest in managing people and "influencing the big picture" started growing.  

我从直接经验中学到了很多东西，直到后来才开始学习和接受辅导。年轻时，我花了很多时间学习技术知识，这与我的主要爱好不谋而合。在担任了一些集成电路职位后，我创办了几家公司，开始组建和领导小型团队。我的创业心态由此产生，对人员管理和 "影响大局 "的兴趣也与日俱增。

I then joined Namecheap, the second-largest domain registrar in the world. There, I grew a team of 10 people, became the director of the Cloud department, and now lead four teams with a total of 35 people. It's only in recent years that I started reading extensively about leadership and management, giving a name to many practices I learned through trial and error. This year I also started writing a newsletter where I share what I learned.  

之后，我加入了全球第二大域名注册商 Namecheap。在那里，我发展壮大了一个 10 人的团队，成为云计算部门的主管，现在领导着四个团队共 35 人。直到最近几年，我才开始广泛阅读有关领导力和管理方面的书籍，并为自己在不断尝试中总结出的许多做法正名。今年，我还开始撰写时事通讯，分享我的心得体会。

Well, while there are for sure certain traits that can make it easier to become a good manager, I strongly believe that being a manager is something you can learn. So, usually, there are two things that I look for when searching for a new manager:  

当然，有一些特质肯定会让你更容易成为一名优秀的经理，但我坚信，成为一名经理是可以学习的。因此，在寻找新经理时，我通常会看重两点：

-   I ask people if this is truly what they want to do and observe their reaction.  
    
    我问人们这是否是他们真正想做的事，并观察他们的反应。
    
-   I search for individuals who demonstrate a high level of commitment to their work and understand that becoming a good manager is a long journey that demands significant effort.  
    
    我寻找那些对工作高度负责的人，因为他们明白，成为一名优秀的管理者是一个漫长的过程，需要付出巨大的努力。
    

The first step I would recommend is to understand why you want to become a manager. There could be multiple reasons, such as seeking a better salary, having more influence in a company, personal growth, and more. It is crucial to have a clear objective in mind since that will be your ultimate goal. Once you are certain about this career switch and have a clear objective, here are the next steps you should take:  

我建议的第一步是了解自己为什么想成为一名经理。原因可能有很多，比如寻求更高的薪水、在公司中拥有更大的影响力、个人成长等等。关键是要有一个明确的目标，因为这将是你的最终目标。一旦你确定要转行并有了明确的目标，接下来你应该采取以下步骤：

-   Conduct a self-assessment to understand your strengths and weaknesses. It's important to be aware of areas where you need improvement, as well as areas where you can support your teammates, demonstrating to your manager that you have the right mindset for this journey.  
    
    进行自我评估，了解自己的优缺点。重要的是要意识到自己在哪些方面需要改进，以及在哪些方面可以为队友提供支持，从而向你的经理证明你在这段旅程中拥有正确的心态。
    
-   Start proactively seeking more responsibilities and demonstrate accountability.  
    
    开始主动寻求更多的责任，并展现出责任感。
    
-   The final step is to have a conversation with your manager and express your interest in transitioning into a managerial role.  
    
    最后一步是与你的经理交谈，表达你对过渡到管理职位的兴趣。
    

Firstly, embrace the change in mindset. Your success is now determined more by the success of your team than by your individual contributions.  

首先，接受心态的转变。现在，你的成功更多地取决于团队的成功，而不是你个人的贡献。

Additionally, while I understand that it may be challenging at the beginning, try to minimize your involvement in hands-on work as much as possible. Instead, shift your focus to your team members. Engage in open communication, strive to streamline their work, and build positive relationships. Trust is essential and it's not something you get for free just because you were promoted to a manager role.  

此外，虽然我理解这在开始时可能具有挑战性，但还是要尽量减少你对实际工作的参与。相反，要把注意力转移到团队成员身上。坦诚交流，努力简化他们的工作，建立积极的关系。信任是必不可少的，这并不是因为你被提拔为经理就能免费获得的。

Managers should stay updated on technological trends and industry best practices. As mentioned earlier, they don't have to be hands-on, but it is crucial for them to speak the same language as their teams. Therefore, attending industry conferences, participating in relevant online communities, or taking courses are important steps to stay informed.  

管理人员应随时了解最新技术趋势和行业最佳实践。如前所述，他们不一定要亲力亲为，但与团队说同一种语言对他们来说至关重要。因此，参加行业会议、参与相关在线社区或学习课程都是了解最新信息的重要步骤。

Additionally, regularly seeking feedback from peers, team leaders, and team members can provide valuable insights for personal growth. Lastly, engaging with a mentor or executive coach can be an excellent way to ensure continuous personal and professional development.  

此外，定期征求同行、团队领导和团队成员的反馈意见也能为个人成长提供宝贵的见解。最后，与导师或高管教练合作也是确保个人和职业持续发展的绝佳途径。

You don't necessarily need to become a manager. There are numerous exceptional individual contributors who have significant responsibilities and enjoy competitive salaries, sometimes even higher than those of managers.  

你不一定要成为经理。有许多杰出的个人贡献者承担着重要的责任，享受着有竞争力的薪酬，有时甚至比经理的薪酬还要高。

Being a manager is something you can learn, but it's not suitable for everyone. It requires a genuine passion for understanding people and the psychology that influences them. Additionally, you must be willing to let go of most hands-on work (which can be challenging, particularly for engineers) and dedicate your time to managing people, processes, and achieving results.  

管理者是可以学习的，但并非人人都适合。它要求你对了解人和影响人的心理有真正的热情。此外，您还必须愿意放下大部分亲力亲为的工作（这可能具有挑战性，尤其是对工程师而言），将时间用于管理员工、流程和取得成果。
