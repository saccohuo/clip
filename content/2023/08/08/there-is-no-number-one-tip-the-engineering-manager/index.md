I was at [LeadDev London](https://leaddev.com/events/leaddev-london-2023) the other week where two of my colleagues and I [gave a panel talk](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london-2023/video/building-bridges-art-crafting-seamless-partnerships-between-engineering-product) on the subject of collaboration between engineering, product and UX. As with previous LeadDev events, it was excellent, both as a speaker and as an attendee.  

前几周我参加了伦敦的 LeadDev 活动，我和我的两位同事就工程、产品和用户体验之间的合作问题进行了小组讨论。与以往的 LeadDev 活动一样，无论是作为演讲者还是作为与会者，这次活动都非常出色。

After our panel I was chatting to people in the sponsor hall, and one person asked me a question which I did a terrible job at answering: **what is the number one tip that you’d give to a new manager?**  

小组讨论结束后，我在赞助商大厅与人闲聊，有人问了我一个问题，我回答得很糟糕：你给新任经理的首要建议是什么？

It’s a tricky question to answer off the cuff, because how exactly can you summarise everything you’ve learned over the last decade into just _one_ single tip? I waffled on the answer so badly that I can’t even remember what I said. I think I blurted out about five bad tips. I had a long think about what I would have said if I had time to prepare and then I wrote this article to make up for it.   

这个问题很难随口回答，因为你怎么能把过去十年学到的所有东西都总结成一条建议呢？我在回答这个问题时摇摆不定，甚至都不记得自己说了些什么。我想我大概说了五个糟糕的建议。我想了很久，如果我有时间准备，我会说什么，然后我写了这篇文章来弥补。

The real answer to the question is that there is no one tip. There is no secret or silver bullet to becoming a good leader.  

问题的真正答案是，没有什么秘诀。 要成为一名优秀的领导者，并没有什么秘诀或灵丹妙药。

Instead, what I would recommend is exploring a model of how you acquire new skills so you can begin developing your intuition on how to be a good leader. With time, this will allow you to do your job without needing to think so hard, freeing up your brain cycles to the things that really matter: building what your users need by running your team well.  

相反，我建议你去探索一种掌握新技能的模式，这样你就能开始培养自己的直觉，知道如何成为一名优秀的领导者。随着时间的推移，这将使你无需费力思考就能完成工作，从而腾出你的大脑周期来做真正重要的事情：通过管理好你的团队来满足用户的需求。

## Operating from intuition 凭直觉操作

Getting comfortable with the fact that leadership and management is driven predominantly by intuition is probably the first step towards getting good at the job.  

领导和管理主要依靠直觉，接受这一事实可能是做好这项工作的第一步。

Therefore you need to develop your intuition. But how?   

因此，你需要培养自己的直觉。但如何培养呢？

There’s good news: you’ve done it before for a different skill set. In order to get a role managing programmers it’s likely that you’ve already been a good programmer yourself for some time. You’ve learned how to learn to write code.  

有一个好消息：你以前已经为不同的技能组合工作过了。要想获得管理程序员的职位，你自己很可能已经是一名出色的程序员了。你已经学会了如何编写代码。

So ask yourself: how exactly do you write good code? If you’re experienced, the answer is that you just kind of do it. It’s almost impossible to distil great creative work into a set of prescribed instructions.   

那么问问自己：你究竟是如何写出好代码的？如果你经验丰富，答案就是 "顺其自然"。要把伟大的创造性工作提炼成一套规定的指令几乎是不可能的。

The same is true with leadership, and it is also true with _any_ non-trivial endeavour.   

领导力是如此，任何非同小可的工作也是如此。

If you ask an expert how they do what they do, they can’t really tell you: they’ll say they just do it. And even if you copied exactly what they did to get to where they are, you wouldn’t be as good as them. Mastery in a complex domain is a unique mixture of individual talent, study, and intuition through learned experience.  

如果你问专家他们是如何做到这一点的，他们其实并不能告诉你：他们会说他们就是这样做的。即使你完全照搬他们的方法，也无法达到他们的水平。在一个复杂的领域中，精通是个人天赋、学习和通过学习经验获得的直觉的独特混合体。

So back to the question at hand: what’s my number one tip for a new manager? **You need to learn how to learn, because you’re a beginner again**. And you can only really train yourself through learned experience.  

那么回到正题：我给新经理人的首要建议是什么？你需要学会如何学习，因为你又是一个新手。只有通过学习经验，你才能真正锻炼自己。

There’s no way to be booksmart about leadership, just in the same way that you can’t be booksmart about programming. Give me an engineer with no formal education and ten thousand hours of industry experience any day over someone who has read every single programming book but has never opened an editor in their life.  

领导力不可能是书本上的知识，就像编程不可能是书本上的知识一样。一个没有受过正规教育但拥有上万小时行业经验的工程师，总比一个读过所有编程书籍却从未打开过编辑器的人强。

## Training your model 训练模型

I find it useful to think about the development of your skills as training a machine learning model that is in your brain. This model is your intuition — it’s the engine that, with time, will allow you to make good decisions and to do great work without really having to think about it. You just do it. And when you’re a skilled leader, you’ll subconsciously execute from this model pretty much all of the time.  

我认为，把技能的发展看作是训练大脑中的机器学习模型，是非常有用的。这个模型就是你的直觉--它是一个引擎，随着时间的推移，它能让你做出正确的决定，并在无需思考的情况下做出出色的工作。你只需去做。而当你成为一名熟练的领导者时，你会下意识地一直按照这个模型来执行。

When you’re a new leader, your model won’t have much data to go on. So you need to think about ways in which you can continually train it with more data so that it can become better at pattern matching new inputs going forward.   

当你还是一个新的领导者时，你的模型不会有太多的数据可循。因此，您需要考虑如何利用更多数据不断训练模型，使其能够更好地匹配未来的新输入。

The way in which I think about this is trying to constantly expose yourself to two types of data: _tools_ and _experiences_.  

我对此的看法是，要不断让自己接触两类数据：工具和经验。

-   **Tools are skills that you can use to do your job**. These are tangible things like learning or creating processes to run successful 1:1 meetings, understanding how to do basic project management and estimation, and knowing how to write and deliver a performance review.  
    
    工具是您可以用来完成工作的技能。这些都是实实在在的东西，比如学习或创建成功举办 1:1 会议的流程，了解如何进行基本的项目管理和估算，以及知道如何撰写和提供绩效评估。
-   **Experiences are the application of your tools with an observed output**. Sometimes this output might be good (e.g. Alice responds really well to a particular type of feedback) and sometimes they might be bad (e.g. we all seriously underestimated that project and now we’re delivering late).   
    
    经验是应用你的工具观察到的结果。有时，这种产出可能是好的（例如，爱丽丝对某类反馈的反应非常好），有时，它们可能是坏的（例如，我们都严重低估了那个项目，现在我们要延迟交付了）。

These two halves are interconnected: you need the tools to feed into the experiences, and you need the experiences to hone and improve your tools based on whether you are successful or not.  

这两部分是相互关联的：你需要工具来汲取经验，你也需要经验来根据你是否成功来磨练和改进你的工具。

Represented as a diagram, it could look something like this:  

用图表表示，可以是这样的

The more tools and experiences you are exposed to, the more you’ll grow as a leader. Let’s look at each of these in turn.  

你接触的工具和经历越多，你就越能成长为一名领导者。让我们依次来看看这些工具和经验。

## Tools, not prescriptions 工具，而不是处方

The first half of your model is your tools. You need lots of tools to be good at your job. You can often discover these tools by having others teach you, or by reading books and articles.  

模型的前半部分是工具。你需要很多工具才能胜任你的工作。你通常可以通过让别人教你或阅读书籍和文章来发现这些工具。

Examples of tools can be communication techniques, knowledge of how to run 1:1 meetings well, and methods to coach others and help enable them to do great work. I do love a good set of tools — it’s what both of my [books](https://theengineeringmanager.com/book) are filled with.   

工具的例子可以是沟通技巧、如何开好 1:1 会议的知识，以及指导他人并帮助他们完成出色工作的方法。我很喜欢一套好的工具--我的两本书都是这样写的。

When I wrote the books I was careful to present the contents as tools that you can experiment with yourself and see whether they work for you. This is the right way to think about building your toolbox: consider, choose, apply, learn, then keep or discard.  

当我写这些书时，我小心翼翼地把书中的内容当作工具，让你自己去尝试，看看它们是否适合你。这才是打造工具箱的正确思路：考虑、选择、应用、学习，然后保留或丢弃。

Unfortunately a lot of advice for new managers is far too prescription-heavy. Especially on the internet.   

遗憾的是，很多给新任经理人的建议都过于偏重处方。尤其是在互联网上。

Consider the kinds of articles that go viral: “do this one thing to become the best leader anyone has ever seen”, “never do this or you’ll fail” or “micromanagement is bad”. Although these get your attention and your clicks, they’re a sign that they’re maybe written by someone who isn’t as good as they think they are at what they are doing, or they are just trying to drive traffic.  

想想有哪些文章会在网上疯传："做这一件事，就能成为有史以来最优秀的领导者"、"永远不要做这件事，否则你会失败 "或 "微观管理很糟糕"。虽然这些文章会引起你的注意和点击，但它们表明，写这些文章的人可能并不像他们自认为的那么优秀，或者他们只是想吸引流量。

I’ll say it again: there is no ultimate tip, hack, right way or wrong way to be a good leader.  

我还是那句话：要成为一名优秀的领导者，没有什么终极秘诀、绝招、正确或错误的方法。

Everyone is a different human being, working in a different company, with different equally unique people, code, products and challenges. Assuming you’re following the [golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule#:~:text=The%20Golden%20Rule%20is%20the,different%20religions%20treat%20it%20differently.), there is no right or wrong answer as to how you should be doing your job. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong, or perhaps they’re trying to sell you something.  

每个人都是不同的人，在不同的公司工作，面对不同的同样独特的人、代码、产品和挑战。假设你遵循了黄金法则，那么你应该如何开展工作就没有对错之分。任何告诉你其他答案的人都是错的，或许他们是想向你推销什么东西。

Instead, try to view all of the advice and books and articles that you read as _potential_ tools. Imagine them being a big box of spanners and screwdrivers and hammers: they might be useful, depending on what you’re trying to achieve. Sometimes they’ll work, sometimes they won’t. It’s handy to have them all around. But only you know when to pick one from the other, and even when you do, it might not be as effective as you think.  

相反，试着把你读到的所有建议、书籍和文章都看作是潜在的工具。把它们想象成一大箱扳手、螺丝刀和锤子：它们可能会有用，这取决于你想达到什么目的。有时有用，有时没用。把它们放在身边很方便。但只有你自己知道什么时候该选其一，即使你知道，也可能没有你想象的那么有效。

For example, searching Google for “how to do one to one meetings” yields over a million results. Which one is the best? Which is the _one_ article that will unlock the best 1:1 meetings ever?   

例如，在谷歌上搜索 "如何进行一对一会议"，就会出现超过一百万个结果。哪一篇最好？哪一篇文章能让你开出最好的 1:1 会议？

The answer is that there isn’t one, despite some of them claiming to be.   

答案是没有，尽管有些人声称自己是。

Approach all potential tools with an open mind and with some scepticism. Maybe pick a few of the approaches and templates and add them to your toolbox to try out. You can keep the ones that work and hone them further with experiences. You can discard the ones that don’t. You can even make your own.   

以开放的心态和怀疑的态度对待所有潜在的工具。也许可以从这些方法和模板中挑选一些，添加到你的工具箱中试用。你可以保留那些有效的方法，并通过经验进一步完善它们。你也可以放弃那些没用的。你甚至可以自制一个。

Be on the hunt for tools, not prescriptions.  

要寻找工具，而不是处方。

## Experiences hone your tools 经历磨练你的工具

The second half of your model is experiences. If you’re working at a decent company, building interesting things, and have a team of human beings working for you, you’ll have no shortage of new experiences coming your way.  

模式的后半部分是体验。如果你在一家不错的公司工作，建造有趣的东西，并有一个人类团队为你工作，你就不会缺少新的体验。

What’s important is that these new experiences let you choose a tool and measure how effective it is. You then train your intuition model by experimentation. If a tool works, then you can keep it and continue to hone your skill in applying it. If it doesn’t, then you can discard it and try a different tool for that situation next time around.  

重要的是，这些新经验能让你选择一种工具，并衡量它的有效性。然后，你就可以通过实验来训练自己的直觉模型。如果一个工具有效，那么你就可以保留它，继续磨练你的应用技巧。如果没有效果，你就可以放弃它，下次在这种情况下尝试不同的工具。

If you’re a new manager, you’ll be inundated with new experiences for the first year or so. Everything will be unseen and unfamiliar territory. You’ll have a few performance review cycles to lead your staff through, you’ll have a few projects and milestones to achieve, and it’s likely you’ll have a bunch of fires to react to and to put out.   

如果你是一名新任经理，那么在头一年左右的时间里，你将会有大量的新体验。一切都将是前所未见的陌生领域。你要带领员工完成几个绩效考核周期，要完成几个项目和里程碑，很可能还要应对和扑灭一堆火灾。

As you step through these new experiences, you can choose different tools from your toolbox and see which ones work and which ones don’t, and the output of these experiences will train your model and make you able to do it much more easily the next time around.  

当你一步步经历这些新的体验时，你可以从工具箱中选择不同的工具，看看哪些有用，哪些没用，这些体验的输出会训练你的模型，让你下次做起来更加得心应手。

If you are able to consciously observe how effective your tools are — and also get feedback from those that you work with — you’ll continue growing as a leader as you hone your tools and therefore train your model of intuition. It’s that exposure to new experiences that will make you better. There simply is no shortcut. You learn by doing. And if you learn well with the model in mind, you’ll find that more doors open for you.  

如果你能够有意识地观察你的工具有多有效，并从与你共事的人那里获得反馈，你就会在磨练工具的过程中不断成长为一名领导者，从而训练你的直觉模式。接触新的经验会让你变得更好。没有捷径可走。你要在实践中学习。如果你在学习的过程中能很好地掌握直觉模型，你就会发现更多的机会向你敞开大门。

And if things feel like they’re hard, then don’t worry — you’re just training your model. If things feel like they’re getting easier, it might be that your intuition is already reaching for the correctly honed tool for the experience that is being pattern matched. You can then stretch yourself by finding new experiences that aren’t yet part of your model.  

如果感觉事情很难做，那就别担心，你只是在训练你的模型。如果感觉事情变得简单了，那可能是你的直觉已经为模式匹配的体验找到了正确的工具。然后，你就可以通过寻找还不属于你的模式的新体验来扩展自己。

So that was the real answer that I wish I could have given in person whilst standing in the LeadDev sponsor hall. Maybe next time I’ll have the right tool available as part of my model.  

这就是我希望站在 LeadDev 赞助商大厅里当面给出的真实答案。也许下一次，我会把合适的工具作为我的模型的一部分。
