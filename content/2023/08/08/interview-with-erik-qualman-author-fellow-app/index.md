Erik, welcome to the show. 埃里克，欢迎来到节目。

**Erik Qualman**  02:33 埃里克-夸尔曼 02:33

Well, thanks for having me. It’s great to join you in the listeners here. Yeah, really excited to do this.  

谢谢你邀请我。很高兴能和听众朋友们在一起。是啊，真的很兴奋能做到这一点。

You’ve had an extensive leadership career. You’re an author, keynote speaker spoken in over 55 countries. That’s a lot of countries talk to over 50 million people hosted the Super you podcast and what’s really cool. And I found we learned that you were the second most liked author behind Harry Potter’s JK Rowling. So tell us about that. That’s really cool. How did you get that title?  

你拥有丰富的领导生涯。你是一位作家，在超过55个国家发表过主题演讲。你在很多国家与超过 5000 万人交谈，主持了 "超级你 "播客，这真的很酷。我发现我们了解到，你是仅次于《哈利-波特》的JK-罗琳（JK Rowling）最受欢迎的作家。跟我们说说吧。太酷了你是怎么得到这个称号的？

**Erik Qualman**  03:04 埃里克-夸尔曼 03:04

Yeah, I had to pitch myself when it happened because I’m a huge Harry Potter fan. And my mom’s the biggest Harry Potter fan. So that really was helpful for her to see that as well. It was a distant second. But it was run by likeable media up in New York. And they did a bunch of categories. One of them was most likeable author, they’re doing most likeable, CEO, most likable actor. And so just so happened that I got enough votes and got second place. So super pumped, because there’s people on that list that I looked up to that were kind of my heroes, like a Seth Godin, or Guy Kawasaki. And so to see that come to fruition was fantastic.  

是啊，我不得不投自己当它发生 因为我是一个巨大的哈利波特迷。我妈妈也是《哈利-波特》的忠实粉丝。所以让她看到这一点真的很有帮助。这是一个遥远的第二。但它是由纽约的媒体举办的他们做了一堆分类。其中一个是 "最讨人喜欢的作家"，还有 "最讨人喜欢的首席执行官 "和 "最讨人喜欢的演员"。恰好我得到了足够的选票，获得了第二名。我非常激动，因为名单上有我崇拜的人，比如塞斯-戈丁（Seth Godin）或盖-川崎（Guy Kawasaki）。能看到这一切，真是太棒了。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  03:44  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 03:44

Yeah, super cool. Excited to get to chat with you today. First question we’d like to ask on the show is, if you remember when you first started managing and leading teams when you were first exposed to it, do you remember some of the very early mistakes that you used to make?  

是啊，超级酷。很高兴今天能和你聊天。我们想在节目中问的第一个问题是，如果你还记得自己刚开始管理和领导团队时的情景，你还记得自己早期常犯的一些错误吗？

**Erik Qualman**  04:00 埃里克-夸尔曼 04:00

Yeah, it’s a great question. I think that in my life, managing teams goes back to college, even as the president of our fraternity, which might have been the hardest role you could ever imagine, where you have to manage 150 Crazy people that are also your friends. So looking back, it was actually probably harder than some of my managerial roles in business, because in business, you got a little more just hierarchy within that organization. But from a business perspective, yeah, I do recall was at Yahoo. I was at Yahoo back when they were kind of the face book of the day. I mean, it was white hot. And so yeah, definitely a lot of learnings and mistakes along the way. And so the biggest learning was I thought everyone thought in executed exactly like I did, which is a huge mistake. Everyone’s different. So you got to figure out what are their strengths? What are their weaknesses in play to those strengths? Where I thought that if I just said here’s where we’re trying to go, let’s go do it that because I don’t like a lot of managers. I like managers for me to come to them, not micromanage. And then so for me as a learning that not everyone wants to be managed the same and not everyone’s going to be like me, which is a good thing. Because that means you’re gonna surround yourself with people have different strengths. And so that was the biggest learning second biggest learning was that they don’t care what you know, till they know that you care. And so you have to take time to get to know these people outside of work. And so that was a big learning for me, because I went in with the mindset, hey, this is work this the job, just do the job. Let’s just get it done. And and so it’s really just digging into the why of how what makes each individual tick. What incentivizes them, some, it’s money, some, it’s they want to be recognized. Some they want to be part of a team. So it’s trying to figure out exactly what makes each and every individual tick. So those were some of the big learnings early on. I feel bad for some of my my team members did I had to learn as them as kind of guinea pigs, but it all worked out.  

是啊，这是个好问题。我认为，在我的人生中，管理团队可以追溯到大学时代，即使是担任兄弟会的主席，那也可能是你能想象到的最难的角色，你必须管理 150 个疯狂的人，他们也是你的朋友。现在回想起来，这可能比我在企业中担任的一些管理角色更难，因为在企业中，你在组织内部有更多的等级制度。但从商业角度来看，是的，我记得我在雅虎的时候。我在雅虎的时候，他们还是当时的脸书。我的意思是，它是白热化的。所以，一路走来，肯定学到了很多东西，也犯了很多错误。最大的收获是，我以为每个人的想法都和我一模一样，这是一个巨大的错误。每个人都不一样。所以你要弄清楚他们的优势是什么？在发挥这些优势的同时，他们的弱点又是什么？我认为，如果我只是说这里是我们要去的地方，让我们去做，因为我不喜欢很多经理。我喜欢管理者让我去找他们，而不是微观管理。因此，我学习到，并不是每个人都想接受同样的管理，也不是每个人都会像我一样，这是一件好事。因为这意味着你周围的人各有所长。因此，这是最大的收获，第二大收获是，在他们知道你在乎之前，他们并不在乎你知道什么。因此，你必须花时间去了解这些工作之外的人。所以这对我来说是一个很大的学习，因为我带着这样的心态去的，嘿，这就是工作，只要做好工作就行了。让我们把工作做好。所以，这真的只是在挖掘为什么每个人都有自己的特点。 激励他们的因素，有些是金钱，有些是他们希望得到认可。有些人则希望成为团队的一员。因此，我们要努力弄清楚是什么让每个人都心动。这些就是我早期学到的一些重要经验。我为我的一些团队成员感到难过，因为我不得不把他们当作小白鼠来学习，但一切都解决了。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  05:59  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 05:59

Yeah, Erik, that’s super interesting. I mean, I love the phrase, they don’t care what you know, until they know you care. How did you realize that? Do you remember the story or the example of like, what happened? And you’re like, wow, it’s more than just work. And they need to know that I care.  

是啊，埃里克，这是超级有趣的。我的意思是，我喜欢这句话，他们不在乎你知道什么，直到他们知道你在乎。你是怎么意识到这一点的？你还记得发生的故事或例子吗？你会想，哇，这不仅仅是工作。他们需要知道我在乎他们。

**Erik Qualman**  06:16 埃里克-夸尔曼 06:16

Yeah, it started with a meeting that I was in, I just run the meeting, and then we’d adjourn. And at the end of one of the meetings, I decided to just, it seemed like I felt the room like through emotional intelligence through your EQ, I was reading the room that it didn’t have as much energy as I thought it should. So I didn’t want to end the meeting kind of on a doll notes or low notes. And so I’ve wanted to spice it up and just said, Hey, just for fun. I want to know, like, what was your favorite cereal as a kid? What was your favorite breakfast cereal? And then you get answers. I didn’t eat cereal at all. Like, it’s crazy to eat cereal as a kid and you got cinnamon toast, and then you got no way it’s peanut butter, Captain Crunch all the way no Frosted Flakes. And then you saw everyone’s eyes light up and the energy in the room, just lift it up. And so from that moment on, I just tried to ask a question like that allowed me to get to know the team better and also allowed teammates to get to know each other better. But I think people started to look forward to these quirky questions that we throw out there, do you when you brush your teeth? Do what the toothbrush and put the toothpaste on then wet it? Or do you put the toothpaste on and then wet it? It’s so just little questions like that to get a little more insight. And also to understand that everyone does think differently. So it’s able to show them that everyone thinks differently. So even though you and I might see the same thing will perceive it differently. And that’s proven through science. I mean, the person at the when I teach at Northwestern your brains trying to make that as interesting as possible. So when I say one sentence, people will actually hear it differently. Even though I said the exact same thing. Like if you had a record, it’s like this is what was said. But everyone’s brains trying to make that more interesting for them. And so even though that sentence is exactly the same, if you went to recording, everyone in the class is going to hear it slightly differently.  

是的，这是从我参加的一次会议开始的，我只是主持会议，然后散会。在其中一次会议结束时，我决定就这样结束，我似乎通过情商感受到了会议室的气氛，我读懂了会议室没有我想象中的那么有活力。所以，我不想在会议结束的时候，大家的情绪都很低落。所以我想给会议加点料，就说："嘿，只是为了好玩。我想知道，你小时候最喜欢吃什么麦片？你最喜欢的早餐麦片是什么？然后你就会得到答案我根本不吃麦片小时候吃麦片真是疯了 你会说肉桂吐司 然后你又会说不可能是花生酱 Captain Crunch all the way no Frosted Flakes.然后，你看到每个人的眼睛都亮了起来，房间里充满了能量，让人振奋。从那时起，我就试着提出这样的问题，让我更好地了解球队，也让队友们更好地相互了解。但我认为，人们开始期待我们抛出的这些古怪问题，比如你刷牙时会这样吗？是先用牙刷刷牙，然后抹上牙膏？还是先涂上牙膏再弄湿？诸如此类的小问题都是为了让大家更深入地了解。同时也让他们明白，每个人的想法都是不同的。这样就能让他们知道，每个人的想法都是不同的。所以，即使你和我看到的是一样的东西，也会有不同的感知。这一点已被科学所证明。我的意思是，当我在西北大学教书的时候，你的大脑会尽可能地让它变得有趣。所以，当我说一句话时，人们会有不同的听觉感受。 尽管我说的是一模一样的话。就像如果你有一张唱片，它就像这是说过的话。但每个人的大脑都在努力让自己觉得更有趣。因此，即使句子完全相同，如果你去录音，班上每个人听到的都会略有不同。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  08:05  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 08:05

Oh, interesting. So tell me more about that. Why does it brain try to make it more interesting? I haven’t heard it in that way before.  

哦，有意思那你再给我讲讲。为什么大脑会试图让它变得更有趣？我以前没听过这种说法。

**Erik Qualman**  08:13 埃里克-夸尔曼 08:13

I mean, it goes back to survival, right? And so it’s going back to how do I stay awake and alert. So your brain is going to if I’m sitting there, I’ve got to go hunt the saber toothed Tiger. And I’m kind of nodding off that could get quite dangerous. And so your brains trying to stimulate you with any kind of information that has coming to them. And so how does it make it more interesting for you? And so that’s really interesting for everyone to know. And it’s also why perception just like if there was some an accident just occurred out here in the police interviewed everyone. Everyone saw that differently even though it’s the same accident. Or if these memes that went wild and massively viral is the dress blue is it pink? You know sometimes when you look at stuff like that, or I was just in an escape room, and you had to listen for tones and then figure out which tone match the tone on the phone and I was doing with my daughters and my wife it literally every tone sounded exactly the same but fortunately they could discern it better than I could. And again that’s also surround yourself with different strengths on your team. And so they’re really good at our stay away that tone sounds like number five on the phone hit number five  

我的意思是，这又回到了生存，对吗？所以它又回到了如何保持清醒和警觉。所以你的大脑会想 如果我坐在那里 我得去猎杀剑齿虎如果我打瞌睡了，那就很危险了。所以你的大脑会试图用任何信息来刺激你。那么它是如何让你觉得更有趣的呢？这对每个人来说都很有趣。这也是为什么人们会有这样的感知 就像如果这里发生了一起事故 警察采访了每个人每个人的看法都不一样，即使是同样的事故。或者说，如果这些疯狂传播的备忘录里的衣服是蓝色的还是粉色的？你知道有时当你看到这样的东西，或者我只是在一个逃生室，你必须听的音调，然后找出哪个音调匹配的语气在手机上，我在做我的女儿和我的妻子，它从字面上每一个音听起来完全相同，但幸运的是，他们可以分辨它比我能更好。同样，在你的团队中，也有不同特长的人围绕着你。所以她们真的很擅长我们的 "远离"，那个声音听起来像电话里的五号，打五号吧

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  09:22  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 09:22

Yeah, it’s almost like anything that you hear your brain in the background is saying what’s interesting about this to me, I do have another question for you but before we go there so tell me about what do you do with your toothbrush? Do you wet it before first the toothpaste comes how do you do it?  

是的，这几乎就像你听到的任何东西，你的大脑在后台说，这对我来说有什么有趣的，我有另一个问题要问你，但在我们去那里之前，所以告诉我你做什么用你的牙刷？你会先把牙刷弄湿，然后再涂牙膏吗？

**Erik Qualman**  09:39 埃里克-夸尔曼 09:39

I went for the toothpaste Ah Then why did again  

我去拿牙膏了 啊 那为什么又去拿牙膏了？

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  09:42  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 09:42

oh wow Double Take that. Okay, very cool. That’s awesome. Very good to know. I just do the I just do it once before the toothpaste comes on for the record. But yeah, that is awesome to know. I feel like I know you really well. Now this is great. And I certainly think that this really does beat the How was your weekend type of repetitive question like this is much more fun and gets people to laugh and maybe bond in a way that they haven’t. So that’s a good question for everybody to ask for all the listeners maybe ask that question, the next time you walk into your group meeting. So on the note of keeping things interesting, one of the things that I have to call out is you have this new book, and the image of the book for those like, you know, this audio podcast, but you know, for those that don’t see this the way I do, you have the image of yourself on the book, and you have these bright green glasses. And you’re also obviously like sticking to that image and have those bright green glasses. Tell me about the story of that is that part of the keeping things interesting? Tell me about like, when you started wearing the bright green glasses,  

哦，哇哦，双保险。好的，非常酷太棒了很高兴知道。我只是做我只是做一次 前牙膏来记录。但是，是的，这是真棒知道。我觉得我真的很了解你。现在，这是伟大的。当然，我认为这确实比 "你的周末过得怎么样 "这种重复性的问题有趣得多，能让人们开怀大笑，也许还能以一种他们从未有过的方式增进感情。所以，这是一个很好的问题，每个人都可以问，也许所有的听众都可以问这个问题，下一次你走进你的小组会议。关于保持事情的趣味性，我必须指出的一点是，你有这本新书，对于那些喜欢音频播客的人来说，你知道这本书的形象，但你知道，对于那些不像我这样看待这本书的人来说，你在书上有你自己的形象，你有这些明亮的绿色眼镜。很明显，你也很喜欢坚持这个形象，戴着这幅翠绿色的眼镜。跟我说说这其中的故事，这也是保持有趣的一部分吗？跟我说说，你是什么时候开始戴亮绿色眼镜的？

**Erik Qualman**  10:51 埃里克-夸尔曼 10:51

I started wearing the bright green glasses eight years ago, it something that happened for me, then at the time, I thought, for my whole life, I’ve been called Erik Qualman. But when you’re handed email addresses at your first job, it’s first initial last name. And so that just happens to be equal man. And it sounds like a superhero. And I didn’t like it for 15 years. I grew up in Detroit. My first job out of college is working for Cadillac, and so well actually as an intern first. So as an intern at Cadillac, so you can imagine you’re an intern, and all sudden they run out coffee. And they’re like, man, we’re out of coffee. Well, eco man, you’re super fast. Once you go get your superhero, can you go get us some coffee, go run down the street and get us some coffee. So I didn’t like the name. I thought it was happening to me, not for me. And people just make fun equal man where your tights blah, blah, blah, where’s the cape. And then in a moment of time, I realized this is happening for me. So my third book, which is called What happens in Vegas, stays on YouTube was doing really well. And they wanted to do a magazine interview and they wanted to take a cover shot for the magazine. And they said, Hey, we’re gonna have some fun with this cover. You’ve got an interesting email address with equal man. Do you mind if you wear some Clark Kent like Superman glasses for the cover shot? I said, Yeah, that sounds like fun. And they go, do you mind if they’re green? Because it’s gonna be our St. Patty’s edition. I go, Yeah, we can do it, everyone. And they bring them out. I’m like, Whoa, those are alien green, those are really bright. Then we take the photo, that a couple months later, I went to speak in Kenya, this is the first time I was going to speak in Kenya. So I wanted to understand the culture a little bit more. And also part of the agreement that we had with the folks that were bringing me over was that I was going to adopt a baby cheetah from a rescue shelter, to help raise awareness that to take the cheetah home, my wife would absolutely kill me, but just to support the local area. And to support the shelter. The right over the woman that was kind of my host for the week, she looked at me and said, Hey, we had Usain Bolt, the Olympic sprinter here two days ago, and he adopted from the same litter of cheetah that you’re gonna adopt from and we filmed him, and we’d love to film you and marry all that footage together so that we can raise more awareness for the shelter. Is that okay? And I said, Yeah, that’s fantastic. And she paused and looks at me goes, but obviously, when we’re filming and taking photos, we want to make sure you’re wearing your green glasses. I look back at her. I go, Oh, no, I don’t wear those around all the time, people would be staring at me. That’d be very uncomfortable for me to wear those just for that magazine. And she looks at me that look at disappointment. I never want to see it again. She goes no, no everyone tomorrow. That’s what they’re anticipating. That’s what everyone Kenya thinks you look like it. So we scrambled around. We couldn’t find a bright green glasses in Kenya. But it was just a all sudden, as in that moment that I realized, Oh, this is happening for me not to me, it’s time to step into my story. It’s time to fully step into it, even though it’s uncomfortable at first. And for all your listeners out there, you can identify with this because that story I just told is really, we’re all live the same movie. We’re just different actors and actresses within that movie. And so your story, you have that green glasses moment, don’t do what I did, which was resist it for 15 years is step into your story. It’s very uncomfortable. At first, it was very uncomfortable for me to wear green glasses the first couple of years. But the way I was able to do it was to remind myself is that this is who I am. And long term. This is the most comfortable place that I can live. And if this helps one other person, by me wearing these green glasses, that it’s worth it. It’s worth any discomfort that I have to walk in. And then things start to open up that you wouldn’t anticipate. For example, a superintendent reached out to me and said, Hey, do you mind coming to our convocation and helping kick it off the school year and we’d love to wear the green glasses at the convocation. And then we want the kids once a month to wear the green glasses on a Friday, once a month and the bus drivers and the lunch ladies and the teachers to remind them that kindness is the most important thing that you can learn when you’re walking the halls within our schools. It’s not stems important we’re going to teach that and you’re going to get into good college but it’s really about kindness in these classes are going to remind you that to be kind that no matter what people look like that you need. To be kind to everyone, that’s the most important thing that we can learn. And so now we’re the business we actually produce and Sotheby’s sold, maybe 500,000. These because when I speak at events, now they want them on the chairs so that the people can put them on the audience members can put them on. So there’s a long story to say, in short step into your story. It’s very uncomfortable at first, that’s why you haven’t done it. Or if you’ve done it, maybe you’re resisting the biggest chapter of your story. And there’s reasons you’re resisting that, because it’s not easy if it’s easier to be done. But step fully into that discomfort, because long term, that’s the most comfortable place that you can live. And it’s gonna start to open up things you would never fathom, whether that’s students wearing green glasses, whether it’s we’re in the business of producing these green glasses in volume. And so it’s really just about making sure you step into your story.  

八年前，我开始戴上这副翠绿色的眼镜，这对我来说是一件很偶然的事情，当时我想，我这一辈子都叫埃里克-夸尔曼（Erik Qualman）。但当你第一份工作拿到电子邮件地址时，它是姓氏的首字母。所以这刚好是个平等的人。听起来像个超级英雄我不喜欢这个名字15年了我在底特律长大我大学毕业后的第一份工作是为凯迪拉克工作 实际上是先做实习生作为凯迪拉克的实习生 你可以想象你是个实习生 突然他们没咖啡了他们会说，伙计，我们没咖啡了好吧，生态人，你是超级快。你去拿你的超级英雄后，能不能去给我们弄点咖啡，跑到街上去给我们弄点咖啡。所以我不喜欢这个名字我觉得这是发生在我身上，而不是为我。人们会取笑我，你的紧身衣在哪里，披风在哪里？然后在一瞬间，我意识到这是为我而写的。我的第三本书叫《拉斯维加斯发生的事 留在YouTube上》 写得非常好他们想做一个杂志专访 还想为杂志拍一张封面照他们说，嘿，我们要在这个封面上找点乐子。你有一个有趣的电子邮件地址 平等的人。你介意在拍摄封面时 戴上克拉克・肯特的超人眼镜吗？我说，好啊，听起来很有趣然后他们就说，你介意眼镜是绿色的吗？因为这将是我们的圣帕蒂节版我说，好啊，我们可以的，各位然后他们就拿出来了我就想，哇，这些是外星人的绿色，太亮了。几个月后，我去肯尼亚演讲 这是我第一次去肯尼亚演讲 所以我想多了解一下当地的文化。此外，我们和带我过来的人达成的协议之一是，我将从一个救助站领养一只小猎豹，以帮助提高人们的意识，如果把猎豹带回家，我妻子绝对会杀了我，但这只是为了支持当地。也是为了支持收容所。两天前，我们请来了奥运短跑选手尤塞恩-博尔特，他领养的猎豹和你要领养的猎豹是同一窝，我们拍下了他，我们很乐意拍下你，并把所有的镜头结合在一起，这样我们就能提高人们对收容所的认识。可以吗？我说，可以，太好了她停顿了一下，看着我说，但很明显，当我们拍摄和拍照时，我们要确保你戴着绿色眼镜。我回头看她我说，哦，不，我不会一直戴着眼镜，别人会盯着我看的。如果只是为了那本杂志而戴眼镜，我会很不自在的。她用失望的眼神看着我我再也不想看到了她说不行，明天每个人都要穿这就是他们的预期。肯尼亚的每个人都觉得你很像所以我们四处寻找我们在肯尼亚找不到翠绿色的眼镜但就在那一刻，我突然意识到，哦，这是为我而发生的，而不是对我，是时候走进我的故事了。是时候全身心投入了，尽管一开始会很不舒服。对于你们的听众来说，你们可以认同这一点，因为我刚才讲的故事其实就是，我们都生活在同一部电影里。我们只是电影中的不同演员。 所以，你的故事，你有绿色眼镜的那一刻，不要做我做了什么，这是抵制了15年，是步入你的故事。这很不舒服。起初，头几年戴着绿色眼镜让我很不舒服。但我能做到的方法就是提醒自己，这就是我。而且从长远来看。这是我能生活得最舒服的地方。如果我戴上这副绿色眼镜，能帮助到另外一个人，那也是值得的。我所经历的任何不适都是值得的。然后，一些你意想不到的事情开始出现。比如，一位校长找到我说："嘿，你能不能来参加我们的开学典礼，帮我们拉开新学年的序幕，我们很愿意在开学典礼上戴上绿色眼镜。然后，我们希望孩子们每月一次在周五戴上绿色眼镜，校车司机、午餐阿姨和老师们也要提醒他们，当你走在学校的走廊上时，善良是你能学到的最重要的东西。我们要教的不是重要的东西，也不是你能考上好大学的东西，而是在这些课程中真正关于善良的东西。善待每一个人，这是我们能学到的最重要的东西。所以现在我们的业务 我们实际上生产 和苏富比出售，也许50万。因为当我在活动中演讲时，现在他们希望把它们放在椅子上，这样人们就可以把它们放在观众席上。说来话长，总之，走进你的故事吧。一开始会很不舒服，这就是为什么你没有这样做。 或者，如果你已经做了，也许你正在抗拒你故事中最重要的一章。你这样做是有原因的，因为如果做起来更容易，那就不容易了。但你要全身心地投入到这种不适中去，因为从长远来看，那是你能生活得最舒服的地方。你会发现，无论是学生戴上绿色眼镜，还是我们大量生产这种绿色眼镜，都会让你看到你从未想象过的东西。所以，这真的只是为了确保你走进你的故事。

What an incredible story, and I can’t believe you sold over 500,000 of them. What an amazing story. But also, I think like that is now permanently etched in my mind, which is, whenever something happens, I’m going to ask, is this happening to me? Or is it for me? Or can I flip it or look at it in a different light? So thank you for sharing that with us. That sounds awesome. So let’s also talk about the writing. So six books in your best selling author multiple times over, we’re going to talk about the focus project, which is the more recent one. But you know, how did you get into the writing to begin with, it seems like you got into it, but then you got really into it. Tell us about that journey to it has  

多么不可思议的故事，我不敢相信你卖出了 50 多万只。真是个了不起的故事。但同时，我想这也会永远铭刻在我的脑海中，那就是，每当发生什么事，我都会问，这是在我身上发生的吗？还是为了我？或者，我是否可以翻转过来，或者从另一个角度看待它？谢谢你和我们分享这些。听起来很棒。我们也来谈谈写作吧。你已经出版了六本书，多次成为畅销书作家，我们要谈谈重点项目，也就是最近的项目。但是你知道吗，你是怎么开始写作的，好像是你开始写的，但后来你就真的写了。给我们讲讲你的写作之路吧

**Erik Qualman**  16:37 埃里克-夸尔曼 16:37

been a journey, I never would have thought that I’d be writing business books. As started my writing started actually in college, my major was business, but I played basketball at Michigan State University and on the road, you have a lot of downtime once you’re done with your homework. And most of my teammates love playing video games. But I learned early on that that was not good for me. I just would play them all the time very competitive and just realize that’s not even touch that after one semester of not doing well. It’s like let’s pause no video games. So I used to talk and pillows yet a lot of like stories, you should write a book. And so I go, I’m gonna be fun. Can I write a book? So I wrote a fiction book just for kicks, and then didn’t realize how it’s gonna help me. But 15 years later, social media, my space is big. I’m the Head of Marketing at travelzoo. We tried to get subscribers at travel zoo today, they have over 30 million subscribers, they get this weekly newsletter. But that was part as head of marketing. That’s my role is to attract people to this free newsletter. And that was primarily via email and traditional marketing in the day. And I started to see my nephew is watching MySpace around like, wow, this person is like obsessed with these things called MySpace. And I was looking over his shoulder.  

我从未想过自己会开始写商业书籍。我的写作始于大学时期，我的专业是商科，但我在密歇根州立大学打篮球，在客场，一旦做完功课，你就会有很多闲暇时间。我的大多数队友都喜欢玩电子游戏。但我很早就知道这对我不好。我总是很好胜地玩游戏，但一个学期下来，我发现自己做得并不好。这就像让我们暂停不玩电子游戏。所以我经常和枕边人聊天 还讲了很多故事 你应该写本书于是我就去了，我会很有趣的。我能写本书吗？于是我写了一本小说，只是为了好玩，然后并没有意识到它对我有什么帮助。但 15 年后的今天，社交媒体已经成为我的大舞台。我是 travelzoo 的营销主管。今天，我们在 travelzoo 试图获得订阅者，他们有超过 3000 万订阅者，他们每周都会收到这份时事通讯。但这只是作为营销主管的一部分。我的职责就是吸引人们订阅这份免费时事通讯。当时主要是通过电子邮件和传统营销方式。我开始注意到我的侄子在看MySpace，他对MySpace很着迷。我在他的肩膀上看着他。I’m like, Oh, my gosh, this social media is going to revolutionize the world, communication wise.  

我想，天哪，社交媒体将彻底改变世界的交流方式。 And so I was at the search conferences, because we bought a lot. I think we spent like 30 million a year on search, which is a lot at the time. So it’s not only search conferences, speaking as the head of marketing at travelzoo to say why do we spend so much as a small company? Why are we spending so much money on search? And then I started talking on social media. I’m like, Alright, search. It’s cool. It’s important, but this new things going to be bigger. And they’re like, What are you talking about that teenage stuff? Several was pushing back. No one would go hear me speak anymore at these conferences, because they’re like, oh, that’s the guy talking about teenage stuff. But for sure, my friends goes, Hey, you should go talk to my publisher. I think you’re on to something. And so literally, I live in Boston, I take the train down to New York, and I started Googling what’s a good book title like social dynamics, it comes up zero results. I’m like, awesome. No one has this title. So I’m going to use this title. So that’s how I got started to write a business books I wrote social NYMEX, mainly because I was getting a little frustrated that people couldn’t at first I was frustrated. People couldn’t see that this is going to be big. And then I went Wait, wait, this is crazy. Yeah, people don’t see it. They don’t see it. We got rid of book to help them understand this wave is coming.  

所以我参加了搜索大会，因为我们买了很多东西。我想我们一年花在搜索上的钱大概有 3000 万，这在当时已经很多了。所以不仅仅是搜索大会，作为 travelzoo 的营销主管，我想说的是，作为一家小公司，我们为什么要花这么多钱？我们为什么要在搜索上花这么多钱？然后我开始在社交媒体上发言。我想，好吧，搜索。这很酷。这很重要，但这个新东西会更大。他们就说，你在说什么青少年的东西？几个人都在反驳没有人会再去听我在这些会议上发言，因为他们会说，哦，这家伙在谈论青少年的东西。但可以肯定的是，我的朋友们会说，嘿，你应该去和我的出版商谈谈。我觉得你有想法就这样，我住在波士顿，坐火车去纽约，开始在谷歌上搜索 "社会动力学 "这样的好书名，结果是零。我想，真棒。没有人有这个书名。所以我要用这个书名。就这样，我开始写商业书籍，我写了《社交纽约商品交易所》，主要是因为我开始有点沮丧，因为一开始我很沮丧。人们看不到这本书会大红大紫。然后我就想，等等，这太疯狂了。是啊，人们看不到他们不明白我们摆脱了书本的束缚 让他们明白这股浪潮即将来临That this Facebook thing that’s now starting to churn out a Harvard by a kid named Mark Zuckerberg that this stuff’s going to be massive for business, politics and communication in general.  

这个名叫马克-扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）的孩子在哈佛创办的 "脸书"，将对商业、政治和通信产生巨大影响。 It so that’s the whole story behind the books. And then like you said, I’ve now written six different books, all within the genre of digital leadership, with the one outlier being well, why’d you write about focus? That seems a little different. They do go hand in glove because of the digital components are pulling our focus. I saw social dynamics was designed to say, Hey, you gotta get into this stuff. And then all sudden, I said, Whoa, you guys took your phones and like almost ate your phone and went into your phone. You got to give yourself a pause and understand the balance between that Flintstones and Jetsons world. And you need to focus not on the social media aspect I told you get into it, but you went way too far into it. Now you got to pull back understand the balance.  

这就是这些书背后的故事。然后就像你说的，我现在已经写了六本不同的书，都是数字领导力类型的，只有一本例外，那就是《你为什么要写聚焦》？这似乎有点不同。这两本书确实是一脉相承的，因为数字元素正在牵引着我们的注意力。我看到社交动态的目的是说："嘿，你一定要进入这个东西。然后突然间，我说，哇，你们拿着手机，几乎要把手机吃掉，然后进入手机。你得让自己暂停一下，了解 "打火石 "和 "喷气机 "世界之间的平衡。你们需要关注的不是社交媒体，我告诉过你们要沉迷其中，但你们沉迷得太深了。现在，你必须回过头来理解平衡。

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 20:00

Yeah, that’s super interesting how you got into it. And you also mentioned that you teach digital leadership. I’m going to ask you about that as well. But let’s talk about this book specifically. So this one came out August 2022. And it is, as you mentioned, slightly different, but very related to the same topics. So one of the things that you mentioned in the book is you differentiate between the ideas of multitasking switch tasking, single tasking.  

是啊，你是怎么进入这个行业的，这太有意思了。你还提到你教授数字领导力。我也会问你这方面的问题。但我们还是具体谈谈这本书吧。这本书是2022年8月出版的。正如你提到的，这本书略有不同，但与相同的主题非常相关。你在书中提到的一点是，你区分了多任务切换任务和单一任务。And I wonder if you could maybe elaborate on that I think like the Myth of Multitasking has been dispelled a little bit.  

我想知道，你是否可以详细说明一下，我认为 "多任务处理神话 "已经被破除了一些。 I think more people now know that they shouldn’t do it.  

我想现在有更多的人知道他们不应该这样做。But what is the difference between multitasking and switch tasking?  

但是，多任务和切换任务之间有什么区别呢？ And how do you define that?  

你是如何定义的？

**Erik Qualman**  20:46 埃里克-夸尔曼 20:46

Yeah, I mean, first and foremost, the reason we multitask is all good reasons. It’s all the listeners out there, you’re trying to get more knowledge, you’re sitting there, you want to get better you want to so we multitask. Because we want to read more of our 24 hour day, we want to get ahead of the competition.  

是的，我的意思是，首先，我们做多重任务的原因都是好的。在座的各位听众，你们想获得更多的知识，你们坐在那里，你们想变得更好，所以我们要做多任务。因为我们想在一天 24 小时中阅读更多的内容，我们想在竞争中领先。And we want to beat Father Time, even though Father Time is undefeated.  

我们要打败时间老人，尽管时间老人是不败的。 So these are all good reasons.  

因此，这些都是很好的理由。But ironically enough, when we’re multitasking, we’re actually getting less done.  

但具有讽刺意味的是，当我们同时处理多项任务时，实际上完成的任务却更少。 And it has negative health ramifications. Because here’s the deal.  

而且会对健康产生负面影响。因为情况是这样的We aren’t multitasking, we’re actually switch tasking, our brain can’t do two cognitive tasks at once.  

我们不是在进行多任务处理，我们实际上是在进行任务切换，我们的大脑无法同时完成两项认知任务。 It can’t parallel process those tasks at once. So what your brain is wrestling with when you’re quote, unquote, multitasking, which now everyone knows is actually switch tasking, your brain is trying to figure out what’s more important A or B, A or B, in that moment of switching, your IQ can drop up to 15 points, which my dad’s always really quick to point out, he’s like, son, you can’t afford to lose that many points. That’s a lot for you. That’s a high percentage. And that’s equivalent of not sleeping for 36 hours, or as teams because everyone on this podcast manages teams, as teams, your productivity can decrease by up to 40%. So again, the reason we multitask is all good, intense, but ironically, we get less done, it has negative health ramifications. So what you want to do is you want a single task, so focus on one thing at a time, again, kind of easier said than done. I’ve now known this for 10 years, and literally every day I do catch myself multitasking. So I have to tell myself stop focus on one thing at a time.  

它无法同时并行处理这些任务。因此，当你在进行多任务处理时，你的大脑正在与之搏斗，现在每个人都知道这实际上是切换任务，你的大脑正在试图找出A或B，A或B哪个更重要，在切换的那一刻，你的智商可能会下降15点，我爸爸总是很快指出这一点，他就像这样说，儿子，你不能失去这么多点。这对你来说很严重那是很高的比例这相当于 36 个小时不睡觉，或者作为团队，因为这个播客里的每个人都是团队管理者，作为团队，你的工作效率可能会降低 40%。所以再说一遍，我们做多任务的原因是好的，紧张的，但具有讽刺意味的是，我们做得更少，对健康有负面影响。所以，你要做的是只做一件事，一次只专注于一件事，同样，说起来容易做起来难。我知道这一点已经有 10 年了，但实际上每天我都会发现自己在做多任务处理。所以，我必须告诉自己，不要再一次只专注于一件事了。Now to turn turn the gears a little bit because some people might be out there go Wait, I thought I read an article that said women are better than men at multitasking.  

现在，我把话题转一下，因为有些人可能会说 等等，我好像读过一篇文章，说女性比男性更擅长多任务处理。 Well, I call that good tasking. So it makes it easier to understand. And I’m a big fan of good tasking. So good tasking, especially now that we’re a lot of us are working in a hybrid environment is you got to take advantage of there’s negative downside of us all working at home. So you might as well take advantage of the upside. So the upside is a good task would be that you have a conference call, do you actually go out and walk in the woods during that conference call? So that’s good tasking. It’s not using two parts of your brain. It’s not two kinds of tasks, one’s physical, and one’s cognitive. Or it could be gosh, I gotta fold my laundry during this call, I gotta clean the house. So that’s what I call good tasking. And so do that as much as you can. A simple way to do that, as well as if someone goes, Hey, let’s have a meeting. It’s just us.  

我认为这才是好的任务分配。这样就更容易理解了。我是好任务分配的忠实粉丝。所以，好的任务分配，尤其是现在我们很多人都在混合环境中工作，你必须利用我们都在家工作的不利因素。所以，你还不如利用有利的一面。因此，一个好的任务就是，你要开电话会议，你是否真的在电话会议期间出去到树林里走走？这就是很好的任务分配。这不是使用大脑的两个部分。这不是两种任务，一种是体力任务，一种是认知任务。也可能是天哪，我得在打电话的时候叠衣服，我得打扫房间。这就是我所说的好任务。所以要尽可能多地这样做。一个简单的方法是，如果有人说，嘿，我们开个会吧。就我们俩Let’s have a zoom and like, do you really need it to be a zoom?  

来个变焦，你真的需要变焦吗？ Do we really need to see each other? Why don’t we make it a walking meeting? I guarantee 90% of the time the person’s like, that’s fantastic. I’ve been wanting to exercise more. Let’s do that. Let’s make it a walking meeting. And then you both understand, hey, there’s a burden mechanize? Of course, you’re outside, no big deal. Let’s keep walking.  

我们真的需要见面吗？为什么不把见面变成散步呢？我保证90%的情况下，对方都会说 "太好了"。我一直想多锻炼身体我们就这么做吧。让我们把会议变成步行会议吧。然后你们都会明白，嘿，这是个机械化的负担？当然，你在外面，没什么大不了的。我们继续走吧

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  23:30  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 23:30

Yeah, I agree. First of all, walking meetings are great. And they should happen more often. I feel like we did more phone calls pre pandemic and then somehow everything became a video call. So it definitely is something that makes a lot of sense. And yeah, as you define it, what the difference is, and I like the term switch tasking. And now that I’ve heard it, it’s one of those things that I won’t be able to forget. Okay, they’re just a quick note, before we move on to the next part, if you’re listening to this podcast, you’re probably already doing one on one meetings. But here’s the thing. We all know that one on one meetings are the most powerful, but at the same time, the most misunderstood concept in practice and management. That’s why we’ve spent over a year compiling the best information, the best expert advice into this beautifully designed 90 Plus page ebook. Now, don’t worry, it’s not single spaced font, you know, lots of tax. There’s a lot of pictures. It’s nice, easily consumable information. We spent so much time building it. And the great news is that it’s completely free. So head on over to fellow.app slash blog to download the Definitive Guide on one on ones. It’s there for you. We hope you enjoy it, and let us know what you think. And with that said, let’s go back to the interview. Is there a common example of you said that even during your day today, you have to remind yourself like is there a common example to like really hit it home? or something happens and you’re like, oh, no, like focus focus that might happen on a recurring basis. Yeah, I  

是的，我同意。首先，步行会议很好。而且应该经常举行。我觉得在大流行之前，我们更多的是通过电话，后来不知怎么的，所有的事情都变成了视频通话。所以，这绝对是很有意义的事情。是的，就像你定义的那样，区别是什么，我喜欢 "切换任务 "这个词。现在我听到了，这是我无法忘记的事情之一。好了，在我们进入下一部分之前，先简单说一下，如果你在听这个播客，你可能已经在进行一对一的会议了。但问题是我们都知道，一对一会议是最强大的，但同时也是实践和管理中最容易被误解的概念。这就是为什么我们花了一年多的时间，将最好的信息、最好的专家建议汇编成这本设计精美的 90 多页电子书的原因。别担心，这不是单行本，你知道，有很多税。有很多图片。这些信息都很好，很容易读懂。我们花了很多时间来制作它。好消息是，它完全免费。请访问 fellow.app slash blog 下载《一对一服务权威指南》。它就在那里。希望你喜欢，并告诉我们你的想法。说了这么多，让我们回到访谈。有没有一个常见的例子，你说，即使在你今天的一天，你必须提醒自己，有没有一个常见的例子，就像真的打它回家？是的，我

**Erik Qualman**  25:06 埃里克-夸尔曼 25:06

mean, first of all, and you’ve heard this a lot, probably from other speakers, but it’s really about making sure when you’re in the moment, if you’re working on something, try to remove all distractions. So obviously, that’s your phone, don’t have the buzzers on the beeps, try not to have a ton of tabs open. If you’re working on that one task. If you can get in a quiet room that she’s usually easier said than done than do it. But that’s key to do that. And then people out there, they’ll say, No, I can multitask. It’s hard for me to do this over a podcast. But sometimes when I’ll have an audience do is I’ll just have them write down that multitasking is switch tasking, that simple phrase. All right, write that down. And then below it, just write a number on there, each letter, so 1-234-567-8910. And so I’m gonna do that right to sentence first, then write the number under each letter after that. And so I’ll have a clock out and I’ll go go, and I’ll hit 30 seconds, most people can get that done doing it that way. I go now, what you just did, that’s a sign, what you just did was switch tasks, you did the letters first, and then you did the numbers. So that’s good. I mean, you single tasking, you did the single task. So single task was the sentence and single task for the numbers below it. Now we’re gonna do it’s multitasking slash switch tasking. So you do the exact same sentence, but different order. Now I want you to write S and then one, then W, then two, and then the i Then three underneath it. So that’s an example of what multitasking which we now know, switch tasking, and no one can get it done in 30 seconds. So that’s what’s showing, that’s a great example of why that doesn’t work, why it doesn’t work. And so that’s really hits home when you do that, that actual exercise.  

我的意思是，首先，你已经听过很多次了，可能是从其他发言人那里听来的，但这真的是要确保当你在做某件事情的时候，尽量排除一切干扰。所以很明显，你的手机，不要有蜂鸣器的提示音，尽量不要打开大量的标签页。如果你正在做一件事。如果你能在一个安静的房间里，她通常说起来容易做起来难。但这是做到这一点的关键。然后外面的人会说，不，我可以一心多用。我很难在播客中做到这一点。但有时我会让听众写下来，多任务处理就是切换任务，就是这么简单的一句话。好的，写下来。然后在下面写上数字，每个字母，1-234-567-8910。我先写右边的句子，然后在每个字母下面写上数字。这样我就有了一个计时表，然后我就开始计时，30 秒钟，大多数人都能完成。我现在开始，你刚才所做的，就是一个信号，你刚才所做的是转换任务，你先写了字母，然后又写了数字。这样很好。我是说，你做了单一任务，你做了单一任务。句子是单一任务，下面的数字也是单一任务。现在我们要做的是多任务切换任务所以你要做的是完全相同的句子，但顺序不同。现在我要你写 S，然后是 1，然后是 W，然后是 2，然后是 i，然后是下面的 3。这就是我们现在知道的多任务切换的例子，没有人能在 30 秒内完成任务。所以，这就是一个很好的例子，说明为什么这行不通，为什么行不通。 因此，当你进行这种实际练习时，你就会明白这一点。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  26:44  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 26:44

Yeah, that’s, I mean, now that you mentioned, even, I mean, I don’t need to do it, I know that I won’t be able to do it in 30 seconds. But yeah, that is a really good example. The other thing, just on the phone thing, I feel like my phone is on silent perpetually. Who knows I’m in a podcast, I’m in a meeting, I just, but what I found is especially helpful is for me not to be able to see my phone. So I actually take it and put it in my desk drawer. Because as soon as it’s out of sight, it’s out of mind. But if it’s there, then somehow like it’s a habit thing, right? My hand will just extend, pick it up, and I’ll look at it from the side of my eye during a meeting or doing something and before you know it, I’m checking stocks and like before you know it like I’m like completely defocused. And so yeah, that’s a trick I picked up recently, which is just make sure that I can’t see the phone. And that definitely helps to love it. So one thing that I also wanted to chat with you about is since you teach this digital leadership course you’ve been doing it for a while. Your books, our topic around this. The topic du jour, right now is AI is this transformative technology that people know about. There’s this wave coming. And it’s hit various parts of, I guess, organizations, but we all kind of expect that the wave is a really big wave, and it will have a much more meaningful impact. And I’m just curious, like, as you teach this course, and you talk about this topic, what are some things that you’re thinking about or teaching people about, you know, as it relates to AI and leadership and what people should do?  

是的，我的意思是，既然你提到了，即使我不需要这样做，我也知道我无法在 30 秒内完成。不过，这确实是个很好的例子。还有一件事，就是关于手机的事，我觉得我的手机永远处于静音状态。谁知道我在播客里，我在开会，我只是，但我发现对我特别有帮助的是，我不能看到我的手机。所以，我真的把它拿出来，放在办公桌的抽屉里。因为只要它不在我的视线范围内，我就不会去想它。但如果它在那里，不知不觉中就会成为一种习惯，对吗？我的手就会伸出来，拿起它，然后在开会或做事情的时候从眼睛的侧面看它，然后在你知道之前，我就在检查股票，就像在你知道之前，我就像完全失去了注意力一样。所以是的，这是我最近学到的一招，就是确保我看不到手机。这绝对有助于我爱上它。我还想和你聊的一件事是，你教授数字领导力课程已经有一段时间了。你的书，我们围绕这个话题。现在的话题是，人工智能是人们所熟知的变革性技术。这股浪潮即将到来。我想，这股浪潮已经冲击到了组织的各个部分，但我们都期待着这股浪潮是一股真正的巨浪，它将产生更有意义的影响。我很好奇，在你教授这门课程、谈论这个话题的时候，你在思考或教导人们哪些与人工智能和领导力有关的事情，以及人们应该做些什么？

**Erik Qualman**  28:21 埃里克-夸尔曼 28:21

Yeah, I mean, first of all, you want to look at it from the perspective of all these things. They’re slow till they’re fast. So a good example would be QR codes. QR codes were very popular in 2003. Everyone said, This is it.  

是的，我的意思是，首先，你要从所有这些事情的角度来看待它。它们都是先慢后快。二维码就是一个很好的例子。二维码在 2003 年非常流行。每个人都说，就是它了。This is a new way to market, the seller uses QR codes.  

这是一种新的营销方式，卖方使用二维码。 But it took till 17 years later in a global pandemic, to where they’re slow until it went overnight.  

但直到 17 年后的一次全球大流行中，他们才慢慢地发现，直到一夜之间就消失了。Everyone uses a QR code at a restaurant and across the board all these things.  

每个人都会在餐厅和其他地方使用二维码。 So that technology existed for a while. Now I’m really bullish on AI because it’s already here. People use it every day, when you think about Google Maps.  

因此，这项技术已经存在了一段时间。现在我非常看好人工智能，因为它已经在这里了。想想谷歌地图，人们每天都在使用它。They use it when you’re using Alexa at home.  

当你在家里使用 Alexa 时，他们就会使用它。 And so it’s already here. Now, it got super hyped up because of chat GPT, which forced Google’s hand to come out with barred. But I still think we’re very early in the game. Meaning the tool is very useful for certain things like I go like I want to ask 10 questions on a podcast, I go to Google bar, and go here’s 10 Good questions. And I could use that. What you don’t want to ask Google Bard for now is what’s the dosage I should give my five year old Have a sip of metta fame, because it’s probably gonna get it wrong. Because these tools do what’s called to loosen a right now so the literally make stuff up. So the first week I typed in my name and said I went to Notre Dame, which I don’t even like Notre Dame no offense at Notre Dame listeners, but they’re kind of the rival to my undergrad. And so when you think about that, we’re early but this stuff’s gonna be amazing. What no one can predict what we can see as this stuff’s gonna be here. Just like I can see that mobile voting will come, it’s going to be here, what none of us can predict otherwise it’d be the richest person in the history of mankind is the timing. You don’t know when it’s going to become fast. And so I think we’re still early in the game on AI. But we’re starting to see it, maybe, let’s say 10 years from now you’ll see it in medicine, to where it’ll actually scan read it, they’re already starting to test this out. But did it can actually read those x rays and help augment or even replace that person that reads it? It could just be real time. Oh, that rash you have you go to the mall and or you just use your phone, take your phone and scan. And it’s like, oh, you’ve got this rash. Here’s the prescription, Amazon’s gonna ship it to you tomorrow, hit yes, boom, you’ve got that. Now, that might be a little ways away. What it is doing right now is a lot of the doctors times chewed up with paperwork, because of our messed up medical system. That’s a whole nother podcast, but it’s really about just, they’ll reduce the amount of time the doctor has to spend on paperwork, because AI can kind of sift through it quickly, or automate it and do it real time. So you’ll see the beginnings of it in the medical field on the paperwork side. But then long term, you know what’s coming is that, yes, it should be able to scan that or read the X ray. And that’s incredible. It’ll hyper accelerate everything. But I don’t know the timing. I just think we’re early on AI right now. But to your question, why should you do you should be testing these things a little bit every day, just to see how you can use them what it looks like. So you’re not left behind?  

所以它已经在这里了。现在，由于 GPT 聊天功能的出现，它被炒得沸沸扬扬，迫使谷歌推出了 "禁用 "功能。但我仍然认为，我们还处于游戏的早期阶段。这意味着该工具对某些事情非常有用，比如我想在播客上问 10 个问题，我就会去谷歌吧，这里有 10 个好问题。我就能用上它。你现在不想问谷歌吧的问题是，我应该给我五岁的孩子喝一口 Metta 名气的剂量是多少，因为它很可能会搞错。因为这些工具现在就在做所谓的 "松动 "工作，所以它们会胡编乱造。所以第一周我就输入了自己的名字 说我上的是圣母大学 我甚至都不喜欢圣母大学 无意冒犯圣母大学的听众 但他们是我本科的竞争对手所以当你想到这一点，我们还早，但这东西会很神奇。没人能预测我们能看到什么 这东西会在这里。就像我能预见到移动投票的到来，它一定会出现，但我们谁也无法预测，否则人类历史上最富有的人就是时机问题。你不知道它什么时候会变得迅速。因此，我认为我们在人工智能领域还处于早期阶段。但我们开始看到它，也许，比方说10年后，你会看到它在医学上的应用，它可以真正扫描读取，他们已经开始测试了。但它是否真的能读取 X 光片，并帮助增强甚至取代读取 X 光片的人？这可能只是实时的。哦，你身上的疹子，你可以去商场用手机扫描一下。就像，哦，你得了这种疹子。这是处方药，亚马逊明天就会给你发货，点击 "是"，"嘣"，你就拿到了。 现在，这可能还有点遥远。它现在所做的是，由于我们混乱的医疗系统，很多医生的时间都花在了文书工作上。这是另一个播客的话题，但它的真正意义在于，它们将减少医生花在文书工作上的时间，因为人工智能可以快速筛选，或将其自动化并实时完成。因此，在医疗领域的文书工作方面，你会看到它的雏形。但从长远来看，你会发现，是的，它应该能够扫描或读取 X 光片。这太不可思议了它将加速一切进程。但我不知道时机。我只是觉得现在人工智能还处于早期阶段。但对于你的问题，你为什么要这么做？ 你应该每天测试一下这些东西，看看你如何使用它们。这样你就不会落后了。

Yeah, it’s really interesting. I mean, as it relates to planning, resource planning, process planning, it seems like if you’re about to, I mean, first of all, it seems like everybody should do some sort of an audit, like, what are the things that my team, my org tends to do? What’s repetitive that happens over and over again? And then ask the question like, Can AI help? Can I help? Maybe do that kind of an audit, but I do agree with you, you need to spend time every single day, looking at what’s out there, because the number of new tools that are coming in are awesome. Just recently, it’s very interesting. I started using this tool. I’ll give them a shout out here. It’s called Munch. But basically, you feed it a podcast video, and then it’s going to automatically highlight the clips like what are likely to be really great clips that you can highlight. Whereas like that was a thing that we used to do manually. And like Mark Oh, that part was super interesting. Like, let’s minute 22 and 30 seconds to and then. But yeah, now like we can just feed it in. And it’ll say these are some potential clips that you can use. And I mean, very small thing. But the point is, like anything that’s a repetitive process is worth looking into to see if there’s tools now that can help.  

是的，这真的很有趣。我的意思是，就规划、资源规划、流程规划而言，似乎如果你准备，我的意思是，首先，似乎每个人都应该做某种审计，比如，我的团队、我的组织倾向于做哪些事情？哪些事情是重复发生的？然后问这样的问题：人工智能能帮忙吗？我能帮上忙吗？也许可以做这样的审计，但我同意你的观点，你需要每天花时间看看有什么新工具，因为新工具的数量非常惊人。就在最近，这非常有趣。我开始使用这个工具。我在这里给他们点个赞。它叫 Munch。基本上，你给它输入播客视频，它就会自动高亮显示你可以高亮显示的片段，比如可能是非常棒的片段。而我们以前都是手动操作的。就像马克说的，这部分超级有趣。比如，我们来看看第 22 分 30 秒。但现在我们可以直接输入了然后它会说，这些是你可以使用的潜在素材。我是说，很小的事情但重点是，任何重复的过程都值得研究，看看现在是否有工具能帮上忙。

**Erik Qualman**  32:41 埃里克-夸尔曼 32:41

Exactly. And the tools are there, but they need to be better to use. You mentioned the podcast is just like, how many photos does everyone have on their phone? That they’re gonna lose eventually, to where that’s a great if someone can figure that out. They’ve got some, okay tools that can do that. But it should really look through and go, here’s the top 300 photos and put them in an album for you. So you don’t have to manually do that. That’s why no one does it, because it takes them so much time to do it to start to sort their photos.  

没错。工具是有了，但需要更好用。你提到播客就像，每个人手机里有多少照片？他们最终都会失去这些照片，如果有人能解决这个问题，那就太好了。他们有一些工具可以做到这一点。但它应该真的会翻看，然后选出前 300 张照片，帮你放到相册里。这样你就不用手动去做了。这就是为什么没人这么做的原因，因为要花费大量时间来整理照片。

Yeah, it’s super interesting. But the other question I had around this is like, Have you thought about, like how this might change the makeup of teams going forward? Or any thoughts on that?  

是的，这非常有趣。但围绕这个问题，我还有另外一个问题，比如，你有没有想过，这可能会改变未来球队的构成？或者有什么想法？

**Erik Qualman**  33:21 埃里克-夸尔曼 33:21

I do. I mean, the top question I get is this gonna take my job. And I always say AI is not going to take your job, someone that knows how to use AI is going to take your job, because they’re going to be a program that goes from 1x to 10x, or whatever they’re in there. They’re cutting up there during the social media post selling and do 100 ones, because you mentioned they’re using a tool like mine, because it’s like so much better. And so really understand that, that AI is not gonna replace your job. someone that knows how to use AI is going to replace your job. But I like how you mentioned this. It’s like, how can we use AI? So we do some animation here. So we make animated films for Disney like they’re short, the two minutes, mainly from a business standpoint could be for Mondelez, cardio, IBM, but we’re looking at, instead of having someone physically program that animation, is there a way for us to say this is what we want to look like. And it can go into a suite like Adobe, and automatically do that programming. I don’t think we’re there yet. But I’m hoping we get there quick. And so that’s like to your point, what can we automate some of the stuff you can automate right now is any sales outreach. And so that could be through any tool like a HubSpot to where it’s like, are you copying and pasting a lot? Or that conversation, the beginning of that conversation? Can you use AI for that cold outreach? So those are fascinating things I think are ready. The downside? You always get asked the downside. Like the example I gave on the children’s dosage. That’s a huge downside. Whereas if it’s somehow you made a mistake on a cold outreach email you learned from an adjuster is not as big a deal.  

是的我的意思是，我收到的最多的问题是，这会抢走我的工作吗？我总是说，人工智能不会抢走你的饭碗，知道如何使用人工智能的人才会抢走你的饭碗，因为他们的程序会从 1 倍提高到 10 倍，或者不管他们在那里做什么。他们在社交媒体上发帖销售时，会在上面切割，然后做 100 个，因为你提到他们使用的是像我这样的工具，因为它好用多了。所以你要真正明白，人工智能不会取代你的工作。但我喜欢你提到的这一点。我们该如何使用人工智能？我们在这里做动画我们为迪斯尼制作的动画片都是两分钟左右的短片，从商业角度来看，可能是为蒙代尔、心血管、IBM 等公司制作的，但我们正在考虑，是否有一种方法可以让我们说这就是我们想要的样子，而不是让某个人亲自为动画编程。然后它就能进入像 Adobe 这样的软件包，自动完成编程。我认为我们还没有达到这个目标。但我希望能尽快实现。就像你说的，我们能自动完成哪些工作？你现在能自动完成的工作包括任何销售推广工作。这可以通过任何工具，比如 HubSpot 来实现，比如你是否经常复制粘贴？或者是对话，对话的开头？你能使用人工智能进行冷启动吗？因此，我认为这些令人着迷的东西已经准备就绪。缺点是什么？你总是会被问到缺点。比如我举的儿童用量的例子。这是一个巨大的缺点。而如果是你从调整师那里学到的冷启动邮件中犯了一个错误，那就不是什么大问题了。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  34:54  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 34:54

Yeah, super interesting. I think yeah, that’s a conclusion. It’s worth spending time every day every week. Look Getting into this stuff. I did want to ask you about another topic, though, that you talked about in the book, something that you’ve been focusing on is prioritizing your day. I think one of the challenges in general for everybody. And I think like at all levels, it’s always a question of where do you focus your attention. And the problem is, there’s a lot of noise out there. You know, every level of leadership has its own version of noise. Every time you change roles, or like the year changes, the scale of the company changes, it feels like you need to do a new batch of prioritization of like, how to spend your time. And I mean, it’s something that you think about a lot talk to and teach a lot of people about, what can you teach us about prioritizing your day in this very short amount of time? Yeah, I  

是啊，超级有趣。我想是的，这就是结论。值得每周每天花时间看 进入这个东西。我想问你另一个话题，你在书中提到过，你一直关注的是如何安排每天的优先次序。我想这是每个人都会遇到的挑战之一。我认为，就像在所有层面上一样，这总是一个你把注意力集中在哪里的问题。问题是，外面有很多噪音。你知道，每一级领导都有自己的噪音版本。每当你改变角色，或者年份发生变化，公司规模发生变化，感觉就像你需要做一批新的优先级排序，比如，如何花费你的时间。我的意思是，这是你经常思考的问题，你能教我们如何在这么短的时间内安排好一天的工作重点吗？是的，我

**Erik Qualman**  35:46 埃里克-夸尔曼 35:46

mean, the good news is that most of us know what the top priority should be. So when we interviewed folks, I did a project for two years. That’s what the books about because I wanted to learn how I can better focus because I was similar to a lot of listeners, that I’d get home, my hair to be on fire, and I go, don’t do that, again, we’re not doing that tomorrow. And then again, it would repeat itself. And so I go, this is crazy, because I kind of control I’d seemingly control my day, more than a lot of people would be able to control their day. And then if I’m struggling with it, everyone should be struggling. So I started ask around, and it was school teachers, to CEOs to stay at home moms to entrepreneurs, they’re all in the same boat. And so I go, this is crazy.  

好消息是，我们中的大多数人都知道最优先考虑的是什么。因此，当我们采访听众时，我做了一个为期两年的项目。这就是我的书的内容，因为我想学习如何更好地集中精力，因为我和很多听众一样，回到家，我的头发就像着了火一样，我说，别这样，明天我们不做这个了。然后又会重蹈覆辙。于是我就想，这太疯狂了，因为我似乎能控制自己的一天，比很多人都能控制自己的一天。如果我在挣扎，那么每个人都应该在挣扎。于是我开始四处打听，从学校老师到首席执行官，从家庭主妇到企业家，他们都在同一条船上。于是我想，这太疯狂了。So that’s why I took the two year project.  

这就是我参加两年项目的原因。 And it wasn’t something new. This has been going on for 1000s of years. So I want to look at going all the way back to the stoics as well as obviously, now it’s harder, because we’ve got the phones, we’ve got the stuff that’s pulling at us. It’s just a faster society. And so that’s all I wanted to unearth was what are the things that we can do to give us a chance for success? So to your point, the most of the people that we interviewed, I asked them, what’s the one thing that make everything else either easier or unnecessary on your whole list? They knew right away. And I go, did you work on that today? No, why not? I was answering an email, I got pulled in by my team to do this and blah, blah, blah, different things would happen each day, urgent things would come out that they’d be pulled towards. And then I go, well, in five years, what’s the one thing that if you didn’t do it, you’d be most disappointed in and they’d list that? And then I go, Are you being intentional each and every day to attack that thing before the day attacks you? And so the shortest thing I can give you that’s going to help you the most is the night before write down? What’s the one thing that I need to do? Like, what’s the biggest thing I can do? What’s the thing that if five years from I didn’t do it, I’d be upset that I didn’t do that project or initiate that item in try to attack that when you first get up before the day attacks you. So attack that before the day attacks you and try to carve out time, whatever amount of time that is, could be a minute, that’s okay, just start. But it might be 30 minutes, just carve that out so that at least you attack the most important thing a little bit. So you didn’t let weeks, days, months, years slipped by not doing that thing. And so that’s the biggest advice I can give you write it down the night before it’ll make you sleep better because your brains been told I’ve taken care of that thing till tomorrow. So I don’t have to think about it tonight. I’m trying to fall asleep. And then it’s right there when you get up. It’s not like oh, what do I need to do today? It’s right there and kind of go after it from the get go.  

这并不是什么新鲜事。这已经有上千年的历史了。所以我想追溯到斯多葛派，很显然，现在更难了，因为我们有了手机，我们有了各种东西在牵引着我们。这只是一个更快的社会。所以我想知道的是，我们能做些什么来给自己一个成功的机会？所以，对于你的观点，我们采访的大多数人，我问他们，在你的整个清单上，有什么事情能让其他事情变得简单或不必要？他们马上就知道了。然后我问，你今天做了吗？没有，为什么？我正在回复一封邮件，我的团队拉我去做这件事，诸如此类，每天都会有不同的事情发生，紧急的事情会出现，他们会被拉着去做。然后我问，五年后，如果你不做，你最失望的事情是什么？然后我会问，你是否每天都有意识地在这一天袭击你之前去做那件事？所以，我能给你的对你帮助最大的最简短的方法就是在前一天晚上写下来。我需要做的一件事是什么？我能做的最大的事情是什么？如果五年后我没有做这件事，我会因为没有做那个项目或没有启动那个项目而感到不安。所以，要在白天来临之前就着手解决这个问题，并努力挤出时间，不管是多少时间，可能是一分钟，没关系，只要开始就好。但也可能是 30 分钟，只要挤出这段时间，这样至少你可以稍稍攻克最重要的事情。这样，你就不会让几周、几天、几个月、几年的时间白白溜走。 所以这是我能给你的最大建议，在前一天晚上写下来，这会让你睡得更好，因为你的大脑会告诉你，我已经把那件事处理好了，明天再做。所以我今晚不用再想它了我正试着入睡然后当你起床的时候，它就在那里。而不是 "哦，我今天需要做什么？它就在那里，从一开始就去追寻它。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  38:22  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 38:22

Yeah, I feel like the momentum of knowing what it is as you get in versus spending some time scrambling because when you scramble you start checking email, you start to check slack and before you know it, you’re down some rabbit hole. Yeah, no, I think that’s really good. And I love your phrasing of you know, is there anything that on your list that makes the other things easier or unnecessary? What a great question. I feel like everybody should ask themselves that question everyday to  

是啊，我觉得，在你进入的时候就知道它是什么，而不是花一些时间去争论，因为当你争论的时候，你会开始检查电子邮件，你会开始检查懒惰，在你知道之前，你就已经陷入了一些兔子洞。是啊，不，我觉得这样很好。我喜欢你的措辞，你知道，在你的清单上，有没有什么东西能让其他事情变得简单或不必要？真是个好问题。我觉得每个人每天都应该问自己这个问题

**Erik Qualman**  38:50 埃里克-夸尔曼 38:50

Yep, and then keep it clean. I mean, try to visit a hell yes, it should be a hell now when you’re given opportunities. And the better you get at something, the more opportunities get to open up it’s kind of a curse until you handle it. So most of us are people pleasers, myself included and say yes to a lot of things. Even though I knew in that day or crouched I’d look at and go oh my gosh, I signed up for that. Oh man, I’m not really looking forward to that so go to the default for this week. Just try it out. If it’s not a hell yes. That it should be a hell now say it nicely and set up a system so you have that response ready. Most of the time it’s probably email to be honest or text in mind, you can borrow this because yours might be similar. You could do different things but mine is like hey, thanks for reaching out to me this opportunity. I’ve got to say no because I’m heads down on my next book. And I’ve got some hard due dates for it so but I wish the best of luck forever can fill this great opportunity. Notice I didn’t say in there that maybe a couple of weeks because they are going to circle back if you do that. In a quick note is better than a long No. So think about if you’re selling anything which all of us are in sales for for anything when you think about it, we won’t get into that sold under podcasts. But think about do you want a long no from someone you’re waiting for that know for a couple of days a week, weeks from a client, prospect know, if it’s gonna be a no, you want it right away, that’s gonna help you out more than the long now. So you got to remind yourself that as well as a quick, short succinct, no is better than a long no the way in and eventually saying I can’t make it or making some excuse about why you can’t go to said project when you when the time comes.  

是的，然后保持清洁。我的意思是，试着去地狱看看，是的，现在应该是地狱，当你有机会的时候。你在某件事情上做得越好，机会就会越多，在你处理好之前，这就像是一种诅咒。因此，我们大多数人都喜欢讨好别人，包括我自己，对很多事情都说 "是"。尽管我知道在那一天或蹲下的时候，我会看一看，然后说，哦，我的天哪，我报名参加了。哦，天哪，我不是很想去，所以这周就默认去吧。试试看吧。如果它不是一个地狱是。那就好好说，建立一个系统，这样你就能准备好回应了。老实说，大多数情况下都是用电子邮件或短信，你可以借鉴一下，因为你的可能也差不多。你可以做不同的事情，但我的方式就像 "嘿，谢谢你给我这个机会"。我必须拒绝，因为我正在写下一本书。而且我的下一本书也很难完成，所以我只能祝你好运，永远都能抓住这个好机会。请注意，我并没有说可能要几周，因为如果你这样做，他们就会绕回来。所以想想，如果你在销售任何东西，我们所有人都在销售任何东西，当你想到它时，我们不会进入播客下销售。但想想你想从你正在等待的人，知道几天一个星期，几个星期从客户端，前景知道，如果它会是一个没有，你想它的时候了，这会帮助你比长了。 所以，你要提醒自己，快速、简短、扼要的 "不"，总比一路上长篇大论地 "不"，最后说我去不了了，或者找借口说为什么到时候去不了那个项目要好。

That’s good advice. And I really liked the way that you phrase the how to say no. So there’s one really good iteration of how you can do that. So, Erik, this has been an awesome conversation, we’ve talked about a lot of different things, talking about great story of how to make sure that things don’t happen to you. But you know, happen for you. We talked about prioritizing. We’ve talked about focus. And we’ve talked about like managing people the way that they like to be managed. And so awesome, awesome insights from this conversation. But one thing that we always like to end on is for all the managers and leaders constantly looking to get better at their craft. Are there any final tips, tricks, or words of wisdom that you would leave them with?  

这是很好的建议。我很喜欢你在 "如何说不 "这个问题上的措辞。这就是如何做到这一点的一个很好的迭代。所以，埃里克，这是一次很棒的对话，我们谈论了很多不同的事情，谈论了如何确保事情不会发生在你身上的伟大故事。而是为你而发生。我们谈到了分清主次。我们谈到了专注。我们还谈到了以人们喜欢的方式管理他们。从这次谈话中，我们得到了很多很好很好的启发。但有一件事，我们总是喜欢结束，那就是所有的管理者和领导者都在不断寻求更好的管理方式。你最后还有什么建议、技巧或智慧之言要留给他们吗？

**Erik Qualman**  41:13 埃里克-夸尔曼 41:13

Yeah, to kind of bookend this, because we’ve started off with this. And our conversation has been wonderful. Thank you so much, and thank you to your listeners is that until they know that you care, you know, it doesn’t matter. And so instead of you brought up, Hey, how was your weekend? A better question to ask is, how are you doing on a scale of one to 10? High to a scale of one to 10? In really no one should say 10? Because that’s perfection. So you’d have to set up a 9.99 didn’t like the follow ups even a more important question, how do I get you to a 10. So as a manager, you’re getting quantitative feedback, do it say hey, listen, this podcast, this author said to do this, this might be uncomfortable. What do you want to do? How are you doing one to 10? And then check in as often as you can doing that? Because you’re getting that quantitative feedback? Oh, that person’s 8888. Other four, wow, what’s going on? And then that qualitative feedback is, how do I get you to attend because you’re gonna get better insights on that person, and also on that business. So like, well, if I didn’t have to do this, it chews up a lot of my time, and I don’t really see the point of why we have to do that. So you’re gonna get some insights into the business as well as into that individual. So again, just ask him how you draw a scale of one to 10. And then this other part, talk to HR first, before you do this, but I would start doing this, and then all sudden, someone’s 889999, then they say, four, I’m gonna go, no, she’s our best animator, she might leave what’s going on? Why didn’t have context that she just broken up with her boyfriend? So in time, use your emotional intelligence and talk to HR first. But I’d like to ask how you doing in life, a scale of one to 10? And how you doing that equal man studios on a scale of one to 10? Because now I have context, is organization helping or hurting that person as a total person? And so those are better questions to ask. And it’s better way to check in most of us check in just around salary views, like once a year at most, that’s a terrible time to check in with someone because it’s tied to their salary view. And so it’s really about checking in with these micro check ins as much as you can, how you don’t want to turn how you don’t want to turn.  

是啊，因为我们是以这个话题开始的，所以就把它作为结尾吧。我们的谈话非常精彩。非常感谢你，也感谢你的听众，在他们知道你关心他们之前，你知道，这并不重要。所以，与其你问，嘿，周末过得怎么样？一个更好的问题是，你在一到十的范围内做得怎么样？从1到10？真的没有人应该说 10 分吗？因为那是完美。所以，你必须设置一个 9.99 分不喜欢的后续问题，甚至是一个更重要的问题，即我怎样才能让你达到 10 分。因此，作为管理者，你在获得量化反馈时，可以说，嘿，听着，这个播客，这个作者说要这样做，这可能会让你不舒服。你想怎么做？一到十你做得怎么样？然后尽可能频繁地检查你的做法？因为你得到了量化反馈？哦，那个人是 8888。其他四个，哇，怎么回事？然后，定性反馈是，我该如何让你参加，因为你会对这个人和这个企业有更好的了解。所以，如果我不参加，我的时间就会被占用，我不明白为什么要参加。所以，你会得到一些关于企业和个人的见解。所以，还是那句话，问问他你是如何用 1 到 10 来衡量的。还有一部分，在你这样做之前，先和人力资源部谈谈，但我会开始这样做，然后突然有人889999，然后他们说，4，我会去，不，她是我们最好的动画师，她可能会离开，这是怎么回事？为什么不告诉我们她刚和男朋友分手？所以，及时运用你的情商，先和人力资源部谈谈。但我想问一下，你的生活状况如何？ 以 1 到 10 分来衡量，你是如何做那个平等的人工作室的？因为现在我有了背景，组织是在帮助还是伤害作为一个完整的人？这些都是比较好问的问题。这也是一种更好的检查方式，我们大多数人都是围绕薪资观点进行检查，比如一年最多检查一次，这是与某人进行检查的糟糕时机，因为这与他们的薪资观点息息相关。因此，我们要尽可能多地通过这些微观检查来了解你的情况，了解你是如何不想转向，如何不想转向的。
