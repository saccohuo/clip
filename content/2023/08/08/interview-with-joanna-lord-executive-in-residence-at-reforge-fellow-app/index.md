Joanna, welcome to the show. 乔安娜，欢迎来到节目。

**Joanna Lord**  02:25 乔安娜-洛德 02:25

Thank you excited to be here.  

谢谢，很高兴来到这里。

Yeah, super excited to do this. You and I were just chatting. I’m a huge fan of reforge. You’re currently in EIR there you were the CMO at Skyscanner, you were at ClassPass and a bunch of other companies too. And so lots of things that we’re going to dive into today. The thing that we like to do on the show is start with the mistakes, though. So if you could rewind back to when you first started to manage or lead a team, do you remember what some of those very early mistakes were for you?  

是啊，非常高兴能这样做。我们刚刚还在聊天我是 reforge 的超级粉丝。你目前在 EIR 工作，曾在 Skyscanner 担任 CMO，还在 ClassPass 和其他一些公司工作过。所以今天我们要深入探讨的东西很多。在节目中，我们喜欢从错误开始。所以，如果你能把时间倒回到你刚开始管理或领导一个团队的时候，你还记得你早期犯过哪些错误吗？

**Joanna Lord**  02:57 乔安娜-洛德 02:57

I love that you jump right in, let’s get let’s get to the good stuff. I mean, yes, I do. Remember because they sit with me very heavy, even years later, I think my first management role was probably at this point almost 1617 years ago. And I made what I believe is probably now in hindsight, almost every possible mistake, it’s it’s actually impressive how many mistakes I made in my first role, one that really stands out. And I think about this a lot when I’m, you know, thinking of bringing on a first time manager or even now because like, obviously leadership. So lifetime journey is I tried to do it all myself, like I it was my first role. I didn’t want anyone to know, I was not qualified because I was not qualified. I didn’t want anyone to know what I didn’t know. And so I didn’t ask, I didn’t lean on my manager for support. I didn’t, you know, go to the people team for support. And weirdly, even though I’m a growth marketer at heart, I didn’t like apply the growth mindset. I didn’t even go looking for best practices or so I think when a lot of my early mistakes, some very I can talk through some examples. But a lot of those mistakes were pretty avoidable. If I had just kind of raised my hand and said, This is my first time managing like any tips, you know,  

我喜欢你直奔主题，让我们进入正题。我是说，是的，我喜欢。我的第一个管理角色是在 1617 年前。事后看来，我犯了几乎所有可能犯的错误，我在第一个岗位上犯的错误之多令人印象深刻，其中有一个非常突出。当我在考虑引进一位首次担任经理的人时，我经常会想到这一点，甚至现在也是如此，因为很明显，领导力就是这样。我的人生历程是，我试图自己完成这一切，因为这是我的第一个角色。我不想让任何人知道，我不够格，因为我不够格。我不想让任何人知道我不知道什么。所以我没有问，也没有向我的经理寻求支持。我没有，你知道，去找人事团队寻求支持。奇怪的是，尽管我骨子里是一个成长型营销者，但我并不喜欢运用成长型思维模式。我甚至没有去寻找最佳实践，所以我觉得当我早期犯了很多错误时，我可以通过一些例子来说明。但很多错误都是可以避免的。如果我只是举手说，这是我第一次管理，有什么技巧吗？

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  04:08  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 04:08

yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And do you remember what led you to draw that conclusion? Or how did you end up getting to that? Realization?  

是啊，很有道理。你还记得是什么让你得出这个结论的吗？或者你是怎么得出这个结论的？意识到？

**Joanna Lord**  04:16 乔安娜-洛德 04:16

Yeah, I was very fortunate. early on. So I was at a company called SEO Moz. At the time, which is now Moz, one of the early pioneers in SEO, I had a remarkable SEO Rand Fishkin, like very early in SEO, and he was smart enough to bring in executive coaching for a lot of the leadership team. And, you know, I like to say I was identified as someone who could use that help, which I totally appreciate now. And when I sat down with that executive coach who has been pretty pivotal in my career as a manager and leader, she helped me see it, you know, she was just like, and I think she what her exact kind of push was, why didn’t we would talk to examples of like, maybe I was in a confrontation with one of my direct reports, or I didn’t know how to do Good feedback or, you know, maybe one of them was underperforming in an area. And I’d heard that from another team and I, and she would just be like, Well, why haven’t you asked for help? And like, I think we really talked about that. And my main reason is, and I think this is really complicated. It’s like, many first time managers are exceptional ICs. And you get all this great feedback, and you’re like, you’re feeling really good. And then you get promoted and you you don’t want to underperform. It’s like the biggest fear you have is letting someone down. And you know, so I think she helped me see it. And I think it often takes an external perspective reflecting back to you, you know, you could just ask for help, like, there’s no shame in that game. And I think that was pretty pivotal for me. Yeah, that’s  

是的，我很幸运。我当时在一家叫 SEO Moz 的公司。当时，也就是现在的 Moz，是 SEO 领域的早期先驱之一，我有一个出色的 SEO 兰德-费什金（Rand Fishkin），就像 SEO 领域的早期先驱一样，他很聪明，为很多领导团队带来了高管辅导。我想说的是，我被认为是一个可以利用这种帮助的人，我现在非常感谢他。当我和那位高管教练坐下来的时候，她在我的职业生涯中扮演了非常关键的管理者和领导者的角色，她帮我看到了这一点，你知道，她就像，我想她的确切推力是什么，为什么我们不讨论一些例子，比如，也许我和我的某个直接下属发生了冲突，或者我不知道如何做好反馈，或者，你知道，也许他们中的某个人在某个方面表现不佳。我从另一个团队听说了这些，她就会说，那你为什么不寻求帮助呢？我想我们真的讨论过这个问题。我的主要原因是，我觉得这很复杂。这就好比，很多初次担任经理的人都是出类拔萃的 IC。你得到了所有这些很好的反馈，你就像，你感觉非常好。然后你得到晋升，你不想表现不佳。你最害怕的就是让别人失望。她帮我看清了这一点。我认为，这往往需要一个外部视角来反思你，你知道，你可以寻求帮助，就像，在这个游戏中没有什么可耻的。我觉得这对我来说很重要是啊

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  05:41  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 05:41

super interesting. And on the executive coach thing, so at the various companies that you’ve worked at, how does that work? I know, for example, there’s some companies like Shopify, for example, that very early on, they brought in executive coaches that were full time employees at the company. What’s your view on that? For larger companies? Should there be a budget for it? Or should you know, executive coaches be on staff? Or what are your thoughts?  

超级有趣。关于高管教练这件事，在你工作过的不同公司，是如何运作的？比如说，我知道有些公司，比如说Shopify，很早就引入了高管教练，他们是公司的全职员工。你对此有何看法？对于大公司？是否应该有这方面的预算？或者说，高管教练应该是员工吗？或者你有什么想法？

**Joanna Lord**  06:06 乔安娜-洛德 06:06

Well, I’ve seen all the flavors. And I think, you know, like you said, when I was at Skyscanner, we had full time employees, I had a full time executive coach available to the exec team, I used that resource plenty, you know, in a plentiful way. at Moz, it was hired, step episodically, right, like, maybe you would have them for three to six months, I’ve also spent my own money on it. And at times in my life, when I didn’t have a lot of money. And there’s formal executive coaching, there’s kind of more like mentorship that you really invest in. So my strong thesis on this is probably the biggest difference between great managers and leaders and good ones, is whether or not they are proactively and consistently investing and getting better at it. And it’s not rocket science. But it is, it’s an easy thing to fall to the bottom of your to do list. It’s like the meeting you cancel is the one that about you becoming a better manager and leader because you have so much other things, so many other things to do. So I believe the more a company can do, the more they set aside budget to invest in their management levels. You feel in everywhere. And so, you know, I’ve talked to companies I joined or companies that I advise and consult with, this is always an area that comes up and I always advise in that direction.  

我见过各种各样的情况。我认为，你知道，就像你说的，当我在 Skyscanner 工作时，我们有全职员工，我有一个全职的执行团队执行教练，我使用了大量的资源，你知道，在一个丰富的方式。在 Moz，它是聘请，步骤偶发的，对吧，就像，也许你会有他们三到六个月，我也花了我自己的钱。在我的生活中，有时我没有很多钱。有正式的高管辅导，也有你真正投资的导师辅导。因此，我对此的强烈论点是，伟大的管理者和领导者与优秀的管理者和领导者之间的最大区别，就在于他们是否积极主动、始终如一地进行投资，并在这方面做得更好。这并不是什么火箭科学。但就是这样，它很容易就被排在待办事项清单的末尾。这就好比你取消的会议是关于你成为更好的管理者和领导者的会议，因为你有太多其他的事情，太多其他的事情要做。因此，我认为公司能做的事情越多，就越要留出预算投资于管理层。你会感觉到自己无处不在。因此，你知道，我在与我加入的公司或我提供建议和咨询的公司交谈时，总是会提到这个领域，而且我总是朝着这个方向提供建议。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  07:18  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 07:18

Yeah, super interesting. And fun fact. So I had an executive coach and actually invited him on the show. So we did an interview that way, and talked about some of the things I learned just to give the audience like a flavor of that if they haven’t done that before.  

是啊，超级有趣。有趣的是我请了一位高管教练上节目。所以我们以这种方式做了一次访谈，谈了一些我学到的东西，只是为了让观众了解一下，如果他们以前没有做过的话。But one of the questions that I did want to talk to you about is emotional intelligence in the workplace.  

但我确实想和你谈谈的一个问题是职场情商。 And it sounds like you’ve done a lot of training in that area. Maybe you can talk to us about like, what does that mean to you? And what can you advise others about developing? If it’s possible?  

听起来你在这方面做了很多培训。也许你可以跟我们谈谈，这对你来说意味着什么？你对他人的发展有什么建议？如果可能的话？

**Joanna Lord**  07:55 乔安娜-洛德 07:55

Yeah, I mean, so it is possible. And I think that’s probably one of the most common misconceptions about EQ. Everyone else at baseline. So one, if we EQ for those that are listening, like emotional intelligence, most people think of it as a singular thing, which is like, how self aware Am I do I know myself? And that is a very important important part, but it’s one of the four quadrants. It’s actually self awareness. Like, can I have a joy? I know how I feel, can I like recognize that self management? Like, how do I manage the way I’m feeling like how do I respond in a room? Can I control my angst, my anxieties, you know, can I, if I’m really excited, like too excited? How do I control that? And then there’s social awareness, right? How aware it is basically, can you read the room? And then there’s social management, right? And how can you control a room? How can you maneuver maneuver a room? And so I say all that because I think it is so important. I think that EQ is for everyone, not just managers and leaders, but there’s work to do against it. And a lot of it comes down to that first quadrant, which is like, I think what what you’re kind of getting out with your question, which is, everyone has a predisposed baseline for how self aware they are some people and I’ll give you an example, like to get really candid. I’ve had people on my team that are drastically underperforming. And when you talk to them, they’re like, I’m doing great, I’m just knocking it out of the park, look at all this great stuff I’m doing. And I’ve seen the exact opposite, where people are crushing it. And every time you talk to them, they’re incredibly low confidence. All they see is what they’re doing wrong. And that tends to signal that they have work to do on self awareness. There are things you can do, but most of it is in the softer side of things. And it’s intimidating, where it’s things like therapy, meditation, mentorship, like healthy dialogues and discussions with your managers really candid feedback discussions, because what really helps someone get better at self awareness is figuring out what makes you tick. What are your triggers? What are you afraid of? And a lot of that as you probably know it and like go way back to like when you were 15 or like your first year. Haven’t 22 Or a time you were fired that you couldn’t that you thought you’re over, but you never shook?  

是的，我是说，这是有可能的。我认为这可能是对情商最常见的误解之一。每个人都有底线。所以一，如果我们的情商对于那些正在听的人来说，就像情商一样，大多数人认为它是一个单一的东西，就像，我有多自我意识，我了解我自己吗？这是一个非常重要的部分，但它是四个象限之一。实际上是自我意识。比如，我能有快乐吗？我知道自己的感受，我能认识到自我管理吗？比如，我如何管理我的感受，比如我在房间里如何回应？我能控制我的焦虑和不安吗？如果我真的很兴奋，比如太兴奋了，我能控制住吗？我该如何控制？还有社交意识，对吧？你能读懂这个房间吗？然后是社会管理，对吧？你如何控制房间？如何操纵房间？我说这些，是因为我认为它非常重要。我认为情商对每个人都很重要，不仅仅是管理者和领导者。很多事情都要归结到第一象限，我认为你的问题所要表达的意思是，每个人对自己的自我意识都有一个先入为主的基线，有些人喜欢直言不讳，我给你举个例子。在我的团队里，有一些人的表现非常糟糕。而当你和他们交谈时，他们会说，我做得很好，我只是把事情做得很好，看看我做的这些很棒的事情。而我看到的情况恰恰相反，有人做得非常好。而每次你和他们交谈，他们都非常没有自信。他们只看到自己做错了什么。而这往往预示着他们在自我意识上还有待提高。 你可以做一些事情，但大部分都是比较柔和的事情。这让人望而生畏，比如治疗、冥想、导师指导，比如与你的管理者进行健康的对话和讨论，真正坦诚的反馈讨论，因为真正能帮助一个人更好地进行自我认知的是搞清楚是什么让你这样做的。你的诱因是什么？你害怕什么？很多事情你可能都知道，就像追溯到你 15 岁或者第一年的时候一样。难道没有 22 或者你被解雇的时候，你不能 你以为你已经结束了，但你从来没有动摇？And so I think self awareness is a massive advantage and leadership.  

因此，我认为自我意识是一种巨大的优势和领导力。 But I think it’s hard work.  

但我认为这是一项艰苦的工作。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  10:10  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 10:10

Yeah. I mean, this concept of some people thinking that they’re doing much better than they are and other people thinking that they’re doing much worse than they are. This is to some extent, human nature and people are just wired differently. Yeah, I am curious if you were to give us some tactical tips on how to deal with each if you had, and we can talk about both scenarios. How do you deal with this on your team?  

我是说，有些人认为自己做得比别人好得多 而有些人则认为自己做得比别人差得多。这在某种程度上是人类的天性，只是人们的思维方式不同而已。是的，我很好奇，如果你能给我们一些战术提示，告诉我们如何应对每一种情况，我们可以讨论这两种情况。你在团队中是如何处理这种情况的？

**Joanna Lord**  10:33 乔安娜-洛德 10:33

Yeah, love it, I’ll give some very tactile examples, like skills I’ve learned over the years. So probably, if someone is I’ll start with the positive if they are over. They’re overqualified. And they’re constantly undercutting themselves. And this is a very challenging thing for a manager because you also meet people as they become more senior, as they take on more projects as they strengthen and kind of build out their mandate. You need them to demonstrate competence. And internally, they need to be seen as an ambassador of those projects are an advocate. And if they’re constantly questioning their ability, and constantly in fear that they’re underperforming, it will come through, which erodes the trust cross functionally, like all the things we know. So probably the number one thing I have them do, and I actually did take this from training in the past is called the is that 100%? True exercise?  

是的，我喜欢这样，我会举一些非常具体的例子，比如我多年来学到的技能。所以，如果有人过了，我会从正面说起。他们资质过高。他们不断地压低自己。这对管理者来说是一件非常具有挑战性的事情，因为你也会遇到这样的人，当他们变得越来越资深，当他们接手更多的项目，当他们加强和建立自己的任务时。你需要他们展示能力。在内部，他们需要被视为这些项目的形象大使和倡导者。如果他们不断质疑自己的能力，不断担心自己表现不佳，就会暴露出来，从而削弱跨职能部门之间的信任，就像我们知道的所有事情一样。所以，我让他们做的第一件事，实际上是我在过去的培训中总结出来的，叫做 "100%吗？真正的练习？

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  11:19  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 11:19

I don’t know if you’ve ever done it. No, what is it? Yeah, so  

我不知道你有没有做过。没有，是什么？是的

**Joanna Lord**  11:22 乔安娜-洛德 11:22

if I say to someone who, who I think is doing really well at something, but they’re just constantly showing kind of lack of confidence, or inability to be self reflective of their performance, and I say, write down what you are most afraid of on this project. And they will always start with some crazy sentence. Like, if I take on this big project you’re asking me to and everyone at the company will see how not trained I am at the skill, it will be incredibly embarrassing, I will be performance managed out fired and everyone in my life will know that I’m not any good. Like it will be some crazy big sentences narrative they’ve built. And you go, okay, is that 100%? True? Like if you didn’t do well at this fair, so let’s come up with a more true sentence. And they’ll write something like, If I don’t do well, that I’d have to present in front of the team? And they would they would think that I’m not good at what I do. And that would make me feel embarrassed. Okay, is that 100%? True? Will everyone at the company not think you’re good at what you do if there’s, so you go through this exercise till you get to the 100% true statement. And that’s usually something like, I’m afraid I’m not good enough to do this job, or something very like about them about their self awareness. Like, I was told once that I might not be good at this one thing, I think I am, but I’m afraid to take on this project, or I care too much what you think about me, it’s something that you can actually work off of. So that’s an example is called the 100%. True, it usually takes like eight to 10 sentences, but you get to the one that they’re most scared of, and then you can say to them, is that so bad? So you know, the project doesn’t go well. And we realize there’s never any need to develop Is that so bad? So that’s one direction. If I flip it, if it’s helpful, that this one’s much easier, if they’re underperforming, but they think they’re over performing, I tend to do the, let me put your job description in front of you. Let’s walk through line by line. And let’s score on a one to 10. You score on one to 10. And I’ll score I’m on a 10 on how good we we think it’s going. And there’s it’s usually like, I call it football fields apart. They are they think they’re an eight out of 10. I show them your three out of 10. It’s an honest way is a third is triangulation. And I can point to and say like how do you feel about these differences in numbers, right, and we can start to talk as humans, which is what we really need to do. And it doesn’t become a justification of the eight of the three, it becomes a reality that we are five football fields apart. So those are some examples and tactics, but I think they tend to help you build self awareness and realize there might be another narrative you have to consider.  

如果我对一个人说，我认为他在某件事情上做得非常好，但他总是表现得缺乏自信，或者无法对自己的表现进行自我反省，我就会对他说，写下你在这个项目中最害怕什么。他们总是以一些疯狂的句子开始。比如，如果我接手了你让我做的这个大项目，而公司里的每个人都会看到我在技能方面是多么缺乏训练，那将会非常尴尬，我会被绩效管理部门开除，我生活中的每个人都会知道我一点都不好。就像他们编造的一些疯狂的大句子一样。然后你会说，好吧，这是 100% 吗？是真的吗？如果你在这次展会上表现不佳，那我们就来写一个更真实的句子。他们会写出这样的句子：如果我做得不好，我就必须在团队面前展示吗？他们会认为我做得不好。这会让我觉得很尴尬。好吧，是 100% 吗？真的吗？如果是这样，公司里的每个人都会认为你不擅长自己的工作吗？所以，你要进行这样的练习，直到你得到 100%真实的陈述。这通常是类似于 "我害怕我做不好这份工作"，或者是一些非常类似于他们自我意识的东西。比如，有人曾经告诉我，我可能不擅长做这件事，我觉得我擅长，但我害怕接手这个项目，或者我太在乎你对我的看法，这些都是你可以实际操作的东西。这就是所谓的 "100%"。诚然，这通常需要 8 到 10 句话，但你说到了他们最害怕的那一句，然后你就可以对他们说，这有那么糟糕吗？你知道，项目进行得并不顺利。然后我们就会意识到，根本没必要说 "有那么糟糕吗？ 所以这是一个方向。如果我翻转它，如果它是有帮助的，这一个是更容易，如果他们表现不佳，但他们认为他们表现过度，我倾向于做的，让我把你的工作描述在你的面前。让我们一行一行地看。我们用 1 到 10 来打分。你从1到10打分我打 10 分，看我们觉得进展如何。通常情况下，我称之为 "足球场他们认为自己是十分中的八分。我给他们看你的三分这是一个诚实的方式是第三是三角测量。我可以指着说，你对这些数字上的差异有什么感觉，对吧，然后我们就可以开始像人类一样交谈，这才是我们真正需要做的。这不会成为三人中八人的理由，而会成为我们相差五个足球场的现实。所以，这些都是一些例子和策略，但我认为它们往往能帮助你建立自我意识，并意识到你可能需要考虑另一种说法。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  13:44  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 13:44

This is super interesting. So talking about the 100% true one. So you would roll out that tool in your toolkit, if someone is starting, say you want them to do something, a bigger project, and you’re noticing a lack of confidence. And rather than just saying like, Hey, don’t worry, you’re great. It’ll be great. Just do it. Which you can also do, maybe you also do that. But if it persists, then you take this tool, really cool tool, by the way and on the job description when that’s super interesting. I think that sometimes maybe the wit, you know, people do stuff like this when they are like it’s performance review time, but you don’t wait for that. Right? Like anytime you feel that there is a discrepancy. You just go to talking about each one of those individual things and and maybe they are over performing in some areas, but maybe in some critical areas. They’re not.  

这太有意思了。所以说的是百分百真实。如果有人刚开始工作，比如你想让他做一个更大的项目，而你发现他缺乏自信，那么你就会在工具包里拿出这个工具。与其只是说，嘿，别担心，你很棒。会成功的。去做吧。你也可以这么做，也许你也会这么做。但如果它持续存在，那么你就拿起这个工具，非常酷的工具，顺便说一句，在工作描述上，当这是超级有趣的。我认为，有时也许机智，你知道，人们做这样的东西时，他们就像它的性能审查时间，但你不等待。对不对？就像任何时候，你觉得有一个差异。你就去谈每一个人的事情，也许他们在某些方面表现得过于突出，但也许在某些关键领域。他们没有。

**Joanna Lord**  14:36 乔安娜-洛德 14:36

Absolutely and I think on the second one of like going through and doing it ahead of a performance review. People it’s common, right, like we think of performance reviews is cyclical. We think of one on ones as the in between time to like address big stuff. But I think oftentimes as managers and I certainly made this mistake early, it’s actually the small stuff that you need to manage because that becomes the big stuff. And we know internally, I’ll give you an example, if someone is underperforming in a very specific area. So say I have a lifecycle marketer, and they’re not being a good partner to product. And I hear that from my product leader. But my life cycle marketers like giving me all these reasons why the product partnership isn’t working, and it doesn’t feel like a big deal. You and I both know, like, once that’s gone, that’s really big deal like once that that relationship, so when I bring them in, and we’re talking about it, I’m not waiting for a performance review. I’m not even waiting for issue. I just say to them, Hey, listen, let’s talk about partnership, marketing and product. That’s, you know, the second paragraph in your GED, let’s walk through what I think did an exceptional partnership and like, Let’s score ourselves on what that looks like. And you can start to identify probably something fairly small that you can actually start to improve something like detail orientation, when you’re cross functionally documenting, you’re working on something. And that’s what your PMS feedback is like, they’re not detail oriented, we have all these meetings, there’s never any follow ups, blah, blah, blah. So I think you, the better managers manage the small stuff, so they don’t become the big stuff. And I think that’s what that exercise can give you. If you wait for performance review. As we all say, you’re managing the fallout not the problem. Do you ever  

完全正确，我认为第二点是在绩效考核之前进行。人们常说，绩效考核是周期性的。我们认为 "一对一 "是解决重大问题的中间时间。但我认为，很多时候，作为管理者，我很早就犯了这个错误，你需要管理的其实是小事情，因为那会变成大事情。我们内部都知道，我举个例子，如果某人在某个特定领域表现不佳。比方说，我有一个生命周期营销人员，他们没有成为产品的好伙伴。我从我的产品负责人那里听到了这一点。但我的生命周期营销人员会给我所有这些产品合作不成功的理由，而且感觉没什么大不了的。你我都知道，一旦这种关系消失了，那就真的是大问题了，所以当我把他们找来，我们在讨论这个问题的时候，我不是在等绩效考核。我甚至不等待问题。我只是对他们说，嘿，听着，我们来谈谈合作、营销和产品。这就是，你知道的，你的 GED 中的第二段，让我们来看看我认为什么是卓越的合作伙伴关系，就像，让我们给自己打分一样。你可以开始确定一些相当小的东西，你实际上可以开始改善，比如细节导向，当你跨职能记录时，你正在做的事情。你的 PMS 反馈就是这样，他们不注重细节，我们开了这么多会，却从来没有任何跟进，诸如此类。所以，我认为，好的管理者会管理好小事情，这样它们就不会变成大事情。我认为这就是这项工作所能带给你的。 如果你等待绩效考核。就像我们常说的那样，你管理的是后果而不是问题。你有没有

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  16:15  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 16:15

realize in the when someone maybe thinks that they’re over performing? When they’re not? Do you ever come to the conclusion that maybe they are over performers, but they just might be in the wrong role? Yeah. Is that something that sometimes comes up?  

当有人认为自己表现过火时，你是否意识到？当他们没有的时候？你有没有得出过这样的结论：也许他们是表演过度了，但他们可能只是在错误的角色里？是的，有时会出现这种情况吗？

**Joanna Lord**  16:31 乔安娜-洛德 16:31

Oh, absolutely. And I mean, if we’re really getting into it, I think you can be an exceptional performer and still not be the culture bid for that role, or for that company. And I think the how we do it ever says the way we do it both need to be true. And I think that oftentimes, when you get bad feedback at a company, like from either a cross functional partner, someone on your team, or I’m giving them poor feedback on something I’ve seen, if they’re an over performer, it’s usually on, you know, the how they’re doing it. And I think sometimes, and I have had success, you can move them around, right? Because there’s the culture of the company, then there’s culture on teams, and then there’s culture on squads. And even I think projects have like this very temporal culture. Like if you need to move really hot and heavy on a P zero project to a company, you can have its own mini culture. So like, I think you can move people around successfully, I think when it’s not on the what you do, but on the how you do, it is harder when the feedback is in that room. And I think as a manager, you have to take that more seriously. Because this might sound poor, but like the different seasons and stages at companies lives, you might be able to underperform on the on kind of the what you’re doing for a little bit longer. But the how you do one strike maybe two. But like, you know, we have to manage that even more aggressively. And because of culture. So critical. So I think there’s a chance and I’ve certainly had success, but it’s rare. I think the the person also has to be up for it right and getting the how you do feedback is harder to hear. It’s easier to hear you miss that number. Let’s talk about why versus no one wants to work with you on a project. Let’s talk about why  

哦，当然。我的意思是，如果我们真的要深入探讨这个问题，我认为你可以是一个出色的执行者，但仍然不是那个角色或那个公司的文化标的。我认为，"我们如何做 "和 "我们如何做 "都必须是真实的。我认为，很多时候，当你在一家公司得到不好的反馈时，比如来自跨职能合作伙伴、你团队中的某个人，或者我在某件事情上给了他们不好的反馈，如果他们是一个表现出色的人，那通常是在，你知道，他们是怎么做的。我觉得有时候，我也有过成功的经验，你可以把他们调来调去，对吧？因为公司有公司的文化，团队有团队的文化，班组也有班组的文化。甚至我认为项目也有这种非常临时性的文化。比如，如果你需要在一个公司的P零项目上大干一场，你就可以拥有自己的小文化。因此，我认为你可以成功地调动人员，但我认为，如果不是在 "做什么 "的问题上，而是在 "怎么做 "的问题上，当反馈在房间里时，就比较困难了。我认为，作为管理者，你必须更加认真地对待这一点。因为这可能听起来很糟糕，但就像公司生活的不同季节和阶段一样，你可能会在你所做的事情上表现不佳的时间更长一点。但是，你怎么做一击也许是两击。但就像，你知道，我们必须更积极地管理。因为文化。所以至关重要。所以，我觉得还是有机会的，当然我也取得过成功，但很难得。我认为，人也必须要有正确的态度，得到你如何做的反馈是比较难听到的。听到 "你错过了那个数字 "更容易些。让我们来谈谈为什么没有人愿意与你合作一个项目。让我们谈谈为什么

Yeah, these are all super difficult to have conversations. But like you said, you need to have them and I love the phrase of you need to manage the small stuff, because that is the stuff that becomes the big stuff. So I totally agree with you on that. One of the other areas is so you’ve been a CMO multiple times over manage very large teams, but one of the things that you really care about is getting people to do less. So I’m curious, when you first walk into a role managing a large organization, how do you think about things like I get the sense that you maybe get the whole org to do less things? Or how do you think about that  

是啊，这些都是超难进行的对话。但就像你说的，你需要进行对话，我喜欢 "你需要管理小事 "这句话，因为小事会变成大事。所以我完全同意你的观点。还有一个方面是，你曾多次担任 CMO，管理过非常庞大的团队，但你真正关心的事情之一是让人们少做事。所以我很好奇，当你第一次进入一个管理大型组织的角色时，你是如何考虑这些事情的，比如我感觉你可能会让整个组织做更少的事情？或者你是如何考虑的？

I am a later life convert of focus. I was like I say that jokingly because early in my life, I was really proud of the fact that I did so much. And I again, I’ll use quotations air quotations for those that can’t see me. My friends, they call me a hummingbird. I run around I’ve endless boundless energy. I’ve been this way since I was a kid. And I think society tells us the more you do, the more valuable you are. And I think that ripples into work in a very unhealthy way, and especially into tech in a very unhealthy way. We’ve all or many of us have probably heard in the book, the one thing, or we’ve leveraged a resource like the Eisenhower box about urgent and important and like, but we’re not good at actually implementing it. Like we love it in theory, but then we just keep adding things on it every day more to do some of its productive work. Some of its people work some of its us work. And so one of the first things I do when I come into a company is I try to understand, do we know what we’re here to do? And it sounds really bad, but most companies don’t. They don’t know their Northstar metric. They don’t know the input metrics. They don’t have an aligned view even sometimes on the time horizon in which things need to be accomplished. So there’s some upfront wrestling with the reality that a lot of companies are being steered And without clarity, right. But once you have identified what we’re here to do, and by when are the two most common questions, I start to audit, especially in marketing as because I’m, you know, obviously on top of that function, the work we’re doing, and what percent of it actually will meaningfully move the needle on those things. And inevitably, you find this bucket of work that’s high priority, this bucket of work that’s low, this bucket of work that’s Opps. And just feels like it needs to get done this bucket of work that like we all think we should do, but no one knows how to prove that we should. And you just need to start working through those buckets of work and get it down to like two to three things literally like two to three things. I’ve written a lot about this, I genuinely believe that time is the thing that kills startups like momentum is everything opportunity cost is heavy. And if you’re not focusing your very limited resources on the right things, that’s just a death sentence for startups. And so I spent a lot of time thinking about focus, intentional time spent, inevitably, you will end up doing less, but better and faster than if you didn’t  

我是一个晚年焦虑症患者。我这么说是开玩笑的，因为在我生命的早期，我真的为自己做了很多事情而感到自豪。我还是那句话，对于那些看不到我的人，我会用引号。我的朋友们都叫我蜂鸟。我跑来跑去，拥有无穷无尽的能量。我从小就是这样。我觉得社会告诉我们，你做得越多，你就越有价值。我认为这种观念以一种非常不健康的方式影响到了工作，尤其是科技领域。我们所有人或很多人都可能在书中听说过一件事，或者我们利用过艾森豪威尔盒子中关于紧急和重要的资源，但我们并不善于实际执行。就像我们在理论上喜欢它，但我们只是每天不停地在它上面添加东西，做一些它富有成效的工作。有些是人的工作，有些是我们的工作。因此，当我进入一家公司时，我首先要做的一件事就是了解，我们知道我们在这里是做什么的吗？这听起来很糟糕，但大多数公司都不知道。他们不知道自己的 "北斗星 "指标。他们不知道输入指标。他们甚至有时对事情需要完成的时间范围都没有统一的看法。因此，很多公司在没有明确目标的情况下被引导，这就需要在前期与现实进行搏斗。但是，一旦你确定了我们在这里要做什么，什么时候是两个最常见的问题，我就开始审计，特别是在营销方面，因为我，你知道，显然是在该功能的顶部，我们正在做的工作，以及它的百分之多少实际上将有意义地推动这些事情。 不可避免地，你会发现有这样一桶工作，优先级很高，有这样一桶工作，优先级很低，有这样一桶工作，是 "Opps"。这些工作我们都认为应该做，但没人知道如何证明我们应该做。而你只需要开始通过这些工作桶，并得到它像两到三件事情，从字面上像两到三件事情。我写过很多关于这个的文章，我真的相信时间是杀死初创企业的东西，就像动力是一切机会成本是沉重的一样。如果你没有把有限的资源集中在正确的事情上，这对初创企业来说就是死刑判决。因此，我花了很多时间思考专注的问题，有意识地花时间，不可避免地，你最终会做得更少，但比不做更好、更快

And just leave us a quick review. Now back to the interview. So if there’s someone on your team, and they come to you, and they’re in overwhelm, they’ve got a lot going on, they’re putting out a lot of fires, like how am I going to have a conversation with them to get them to the point where they can be more focused on the most important things? Because prioritization. I mean, it’s easy for us to say, but sometimes it you know, it is hard to do. Yeah. So yeah, how would you approach that conversation?

**Joanna Lord**  21:54 乔安娜-洛德 21:54

I mean, the first thing and by the way, this is like feel like most of my days, right? Especially when my my larger teams, like Skyscanner was a very large team, the majority of my conversation is trying to align my team, individual ICs, or managers or managers of managers, and making sure that their to do list, one aligns with each other so that everyone can be done, and they’re not blocked on cross dependencies. But that that ladders up to what the business needs done. And inevitably, about 60 70% of the time, people come overwhelmed. And so one, I think this is more the human side, I think there’s just like an acknowledging like the needs to happen before you start to audit and fix the problem where it’s like, I want you to know, this is not okay, and I’m not gonna let it continue. I think a lot of managers skip that step where they’re like, well, let’s solve it. If you feel overwhelmed, we got to fix that. And it’s like, let’s just take a minute and be like, I appreciate how hot you’re running. But I want you to know, I commit to helping you solve this, like, this is not how I want you to run. And I think a lot that goes a long way. Because it gives them a moment of reprieve like I’m not going to be fired, or scored poorly, if I do less. And it’s just as much mental, right? Because we take on, we say yes, before something hits our to do lists, so and then giving them the freedom to say no, once you get that part aside, I think there’s okay write down everything that you’re doing everything you’re touching, nothing’s too small, nothing’s too big. Every I want to look at your calendar, I want to do an audit, I want to color code, the people meetings, the weekly regulars versus the project meetings, and I want you to come up with a first pass on what you would stop doing if you had full autonomy, what projects on your to do list. And oftentimes, they’re the cross functional projects, they’re like, I don’t understand why we’re working on this. I don’t get it, you know, and we work through all of those. And oftentimes, honestly, and it’s me going to other functions, and actually having the hard conversation with my CPA or my head of product. Hey, I hear from someone that like when they’re in the meetings on these projects from taking a long time, we’ve received it three times, the KPIs feel soft, like, have you are you in the loop on this or in you know, I’m not even joking, even 50% 60% majority of the time, they tell me they’re hearing from their team, they shouldn’t be doing it. So like, I think there’s a lot of work that gets created, cross functionally with the best of intention that could get killed. But I think it’s as simple as acknowledging and releasing them of the expectation of speed for speed sake, that more is more, it’s auditing. having them write down everything they’re doing, have them audit their calendars that we really know where the time is going. And then you usually start to think to yourself, Okay, what can we actually stop and what hard conversations have to happen to make that possible? It’s never just them in me that can make that call a lot of the really time consuming things for everyone is cross functional. So you end you end up having to really, really approach those hard conversations. Yeah, this is  

我的意思是，第一件事，顺便说一下，这就像是我每天的大部分时间，对吗？特别是当我的团队规模较大时，比如 Skyscanner 是一个非常庞大的团队，我的大部分谈话都是在努力调整我的团队、各个 IC 或经理或经理的经理，确保他们的待办事项清单相互一致，以便每个人都能完成工作，而且他们不会因为交叉依赖而受阻。但是，这也是业务需要完成的阶梯。不可避免的是，大约有 60% 70% 的时间，人们会感到力不从心。因此，首先，我认为这更多的是人性方面的问题，我认为在你开始审核和解决问题之前，你需要承认这一点，就像，我想让你知道，这是不对的，我不会让它继续下去。我认为很多管理者都会跳过这一步，他们会说，好吧，我们来解决这个问题。如果你觉得不堪重负，我们就得解决这个问题。这就好比，让我们花点时间说，我很感激你的工作有多忙。但我想让你知道，我承诺帮你解决这个问题，就像，这不是我想让你运行的方式。我觉得这样做很有意义。因为这给了他们片刻的缓和，就像我不会被炒鱿鱼，也不会因为做得少而被打分。这同样也是一种心理压力，对吗？因为我们会承担，我们会说 "是"，然后事情才会出现在我们的待办事项清单上，所以，给他们说 "不 "的自由，一旦你把那部分放在一边，我觉得就可以把你正在做的一切都写下来，你接触到的一切，没有什么太小，也没有什么太大。 我想看看你的日程表，我想做一次审计，我想用颜色代码标明人员会议、每周例会和项目会议，我想让你首先想一想，如果你有完全的自主权，你会停止做哪些事情，你的待办事项清单上有哪些项目。很多时候，这些都是跨职能项目，他们会说，我不明白为什么我们要做这个。我不明白，你知道的，我们会解决所有这些问题。很多时候，老实说，是我去找其他职能部门，与我的注册会计师或产品主管进行艰难的对话。嘿，我听到有人说，当他们在这些项目的会议上花了很长时间，我们已经收到了三次，KPI感觉很软，就像，你有你在这个圈子里，或者在你知道，我甚至不是在开玩笑，甚至50％60％的大部分时间，他们告诉我，他们听到他们的团队，他们不应该这样做。所以，我认为有很多工作都是出于好意跨职能创建的，可能会被扼杀在摇篮里。让他们写下他们所做的一切，让他们审核他们的日历，让我们真正知道时间都去哪儿了。然后，你通常会开始思考：好吧，我们到底可以停止什么，必须进行哪些艰难的对话才能实现这一点？对每个人来说，很多真正耗时的事情都是跨职能的。因此，你最终不得不真正地、真正地接近那些艰难的对话。是的，这是

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  24:45  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 24:45

really interesting. And of course, like for first line managers, this is a thing that they do, but I feel like you know, this is even more important that the more senior you get within the org, a lot of it is trying to figure out where time is wasted or what things don’t need to be done and These days everybody’s talking about efficiencies. And so, I mean, this is a way that you can get your team to do more by doing less. Right. And by doing the more important things, and I think that’s super valuable. The thing that I wanted to also ask you about, it’s kind of an aside, but what do you think about like, as you’ve continued to have more and more senior roles? How do you think about the craft of marketing itself and giving yourself time to practice the craft? And do you feel like it’s important for leaders to always have something that they can very directly touch? Or do at some point, you just have to give that up completely, and just become focused on the people and the numbers?  

真的很有趣。当然，对于一线经理来说，这也是他们要做的事情，但我觉得，你知道，这一点更重要的是，你在组织中的级别越高，很多事情就越要想办法找出时间浪费在哪里，或者哪些事情不需要做，而现在每个人都在谈论效率。所以，我的意思是，这是一种可以让你的团队少做事多做事的方法。没错。通过做更重要的事情，我认为这是非常有价值的。我还想问你一个问题，这是一个旁观者的问题，但随着你不断担任越来越多的高级职务，你是怎么想的？你是如何看待市场营销本身的技巧，以及如何给自己时间去练习技巧的？你觉得对于领导者来说，总是拥有一些他们可以直接接触到的东西是否很重要？还是说，在某些时候，你必须完全放弃这一点，而只专注于人和数字？

**Joanna Lord**  25:43 乔安娜-洛德 25:43

I have such strong thoughts on this. I’m like, smiling, as you asked this question, you have to still touch the work. How else will I ever be able to help my marketers like, I learned this lesson in a, like, I got too far from the work in one of my roles, and I became more of a managerial head, like I was super people oriented. And way too focused candidly on my executive board, exec, board management, executive team contributions. And one every time I was asked a question about the details, I didn’t know the answer. And you know, that’s not good. But too, as my team came to me, and I just couldn’t really truly help solve many problems, I’d have to go like, understand all this context I didn’t have, I think, when I went to ClassPass, was the first time I really tried to hone this specific skill, which is, how do you know when to delegate? How do you know when to be in the room? How do you help people know why you’re in the room? How can you still be an IC, even though you might be a C level or a VP level? And when and how do you do that? So I deeply believe in I do, you’ll see this at any role I’m in, I try to delegate as much as I can, because that’s why I hire great people. But I hold on to like the marquee projects, the ones that kind of either map out to the most important metric, and or have the most eyes. So like sometimes you have a cross functional seasonal campaign. It’s meant to drive a lot of work. But it also has a lot of people involved, right? I try to stay very involved in those projects, meaning I’m in the brainstorms, I’m in the ideation, I’m in the scope reviews, I’m in the Crip, you know, design crypts, right. And I think that people appreciate it. Because I show up as a marketer, I don’t show up as a CMO, I show up as just like someone who has done a lot of marketing. And then the other place that I really still go deep, because I think it’s super important isn’t martech. And I think that I’ll be really candid, if I can show up on projects like CRM, integrations, or ESP decisions, or any sort of like really deep project we want to do with personalization, that requires pride. And if I stay in those details, one, those are costly projects. So like I need to be on top of them. But to it earns a lot of respect internally, from product from engineering and from marketing. Because no one wants to do that project. Literally no one, everyone wishes that one was off their plate.  

我对此有强烈的想法。我想，微笑着回答你的这个问题，你必须仍然接触到工作。我在一次工作中离工作太远，变得更像一个管理者，就像我是一个超级以人为本的人。我过于专注于我的执行董事会、执行层、董事会管理、执行团队的贡献。每次有人问我关于细节的问题，我都不知道答案。要知道，这可不是什么好事。但是，当我的团队来找我时，我也无法真正帮助他们解决很多问题，我必须去了解所有这些我不了解的情况，我想，当我去 ClassPass 的时候，是我第一次真正尝试磨练这种特定的技能，那就是，你如何知道何时授权？你怎么知道什么时候该在房间里？如何让别人知道你为什么在房间里？即使你可能是 C 级或 VP 级，你如何仍能成为 IC？何时以及如何做到这一点？因此，我深信我所做的一切，你会在我所担任的任何角色中看到这一点，我尽可能多地授权，因为这就是我聘用优秀人才的原因。但我也会坚持做一些重要的项目，这些项目要么是最重要的指标，要么是最吸引眼球的。比如有时你会有一个跨职能的季节性活动。它旨在推动大量工作。但也有很多人参与其中，对吧？我尽量参与到这些项目中，也就是说，我参与头脑风暴，参与构思，参与范围审查，参与 Crip，你知道的，参与设计，对吧。我觉得人们很欣赏这一点。 因为我是以营销人员的身份出现的，我不是以 CMO 的身份出现的，我只是以做过很多营销工作的人的身份出现的。而我真正深入研究的另一个领域，因为我认为它超级重要，那就是市场营销技术。我认为，我会非常坦率地说，如果我能在客户关系管理、集成或 ESP 决策等项目中出现，或者在任何我们想做的个性化项目中出现，那就需要自豪感。如果我停留在这些细节上，第一，这些项目成本很高。因此，我需要对它们加以重视。但这也会赢得产品、工程和营销部门的尊重。因为没有人愿意做这个项目。从字面上看，没有人，每个人都希望那个项目不在他们的盘子里。And they tend to take nine to 10 to 11 months and nine.  

他们往往需要 9 到 10 到 11 个月和 9 个月。 So like, I think it’s important, every marketing leader needs to pick which project is the one but like, for me, it’s either really high visible projects, because they have a really important metric. I mean, if this is a any sort of marketing activity, that we’re about to make a change, and it could affect our revenue, I’m on it. And if it’s a high visibility, or you know, a lot of people are on the project, I’m on it. And then if it’s a martec project, I tried to stay close, I think you have to get out of some of the projects, I get looped in on a lot of things. And I think it’s important that you you say actually, she’s your person, or he’s your person for that. And I think it’s actually really important you draw that line, or you’ll you’ll never find the time to be a leader. Yeah,  

所以，我认为这很重要，每个营销领导者都需要选择哪个项目，但对我来说，要么是知名度很高的项目，因为它们有非常重要的指标。我的意思是，如果这是一个任何形式的营销活动，我们即将做出改变，而这可能会影响我们的收入，我就会参与其中。如果它的知名度很高，或者你知道，很多人都在关注这个项目，我也会参与。如果是马特克项目，我会尽量跟进，我认为你必须从一些项目中抽身出来，很多事情我都会参与。我觉得重要的是，你得说，她是你的人，或者他是你的人。我认为这一点非常重要，你必须划清界限，否则你就永远找不到做领导的时间。是啊

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  28:36  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 28:36

this is really excellent. I think it shows a lot of lessons in ways that you never forget the craft, and you continue to get better at it. If you were advising someone who’s newly become a manager or leader, and you know, this is always a question to ask, right? Like, how much managing is there? And how much you know, how close can I stay to my craft and keep evolving there? Yeah, how would you advise them?  

这真是太好了。我认为它展示了很多经验教训，让你永远不会忘记这门手艺，并不断精益求精。如果你在给新近成为管理者或领导者的人提供建议，你知道，这总是一个要问的问题，对吗？比如，管理的内容有多少？你知道，我有多接近我的手艺，并在那里不断发展？是啊，你会怎么建议他们？

**Joanna Lord**  28:59 乔安娜-洛德 28:59

I probably would think of it. So especially I’ll use marketing, but I think it translates to other functions, I think of the journey of a marketer and like this tree ad, right? You’re an IC, you’re probably not managing, you’re on top of your function, your tea isn’t that function, right? It’s like, you’re exceptional at that one part of marketing, maybe paid, you’re fairly good at other things across the stack, like you know what organic means, you know, I think as you become a manager or a leader, so you’re kind of in that head of director of level, you become a tea, you were the function like maybe it’s all of growth or all of brand becomes your depth, but you have to start to think about the other domains like the entire other domains of marketing. And one of the other domains needs to be management. So like you, you basically it’s like I’m deep on growth, but I understand brand, I understand product marketing, and I’m starting to study what it means to be a great manager and leader. I think when you go up one more level, maybe your manager managers, your C level or VP, your depth is your function, all of marketing, but then I need to be great At product and engineering and finance, and one of mine is leadership, executive leadership. In all of those steps that you make, you have to find rhythms or cadences or ways to stay close to the craft that you’re stretching into. And I think that that could be as simple as continuing to be a student of it or involved in it like digital communities reading about it podcasts about it. Like, I think it could be as simple as that. I think it’s usually something more proactive, like, I want to go seek out for the first time ever, I’m a growth marketer, I want to go seek out communities and brand leaders and learn from them, and how do they work better with growth leaders? How do I better with them? So I think there tends to be more needed, the further up you go. But I just make it clear. It’s an expectation. And I actually think a lot of leaders, don’t they, I think when someone becomes a first time manager, they say you’re a manager now. And so they get rid of the whole team. They’re like, Okay, well, I’m not a marketer anymore. I’m a manager. And it’s like, no, you know, I hired you for a functional role. But now an entire nother dimension of that role is being added. But you have to be as proactive about that, as you would be anything else you’re learning.  

我可能会想到它。所以，特别是我会用营销，但我认为它可以转化为其他功能，我认为营销人员的旅程，就像这棵树的广告，对不对？你是一个集成电路，你可能不管理，你在你的功能之上，你的茶不是那个功能，对吗？这就好比，你在营销的某一个部分出类拔萃，也许是付费的，但你在整个堆栈的其他方面相当出色，就像你知道有机意味着什么，你知道，我认为当你成为一个经理或领导者时，所以你有点像主任级别的头，你成为了一个茶，你的功能就像也许是所有的增长或所有的品牌成为你的深度，但你必须开始考虑其他领域，就像整个营销的其他领域。其中一个领域就是管理。所以，就像你一样，你基本上就像我在增长方面很有深度，但我了解品牌，我了解产品营销，我开始研究成为一名优秀的管理者和领导者意味着什么。我认为，当你再往上升一级时，也许你的经理人、C 级或副总裁，你的深度就是你的职能，所有的市场营销，但我需要在产品、工程和财务方面表现出色，而我的其中一个职能就是领导力，执行领导力。在所有这些步骤中，你都必须找到节奏、韵律或方法，以贴近你所从事的行业。我认为，这可以很简单，就像继续成为它的学生，或者参与它，比如数字社区，阅读关于它的播客。我觉得就这么简单。 我认为这通常是更积极主动的事情，比如，我想去寻找有史以来第一次，我是一个成长型营销人员，我想去寻找社区和品牌领导者，向他们学习，他们如何与成长型领导者更好地合作？我如何更好地与他们合作？因此，我认为越往上，需要的东西就越多。但我只是说清楚。这是一种期望。实际上，我认为很多领导者，当他们第一次成为管理者时，他们会说你现在是管理者了。于是他们就把整个团队打发走了。他们会说，好吧，我不再是营销人员了。我是经理了。这就好比，不，你知道，我雇你是为了一个职能角色。但现在，这个角色又多了一个全新的维度。但是，你必须对此积极主动，就像你学习其他任何东西一样。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  31:05  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 31:05

Yeah, I think it’s super Excellent. And it’s one of those things that is a debate that comes in cycles, and we’re definitely in this cycle of you need to be able to get into the weeds. I mean, I just go back to the thing that you said, which was, you know, if you’re asked about something or project or you know, the details, if your answer every time is I have to check with my team. Now, sometimes that makes sense. But if it’s every time, then potentially, that’s a sign that you’ve gotten too far away from the craft.  

是的，我认为这非常出色。这是一个周期性的争论，我们现在肯定正处于这个周期，你需要能够深入到杂草中去。我的意思是，我想回到你说过的那句话，你知道，如果你被问及一些事情或项目，或者你知道，细节，如果你每次的回答都是我必须和我的团队确认一下。现在，有时这是有道理的。但如果每次都是这样，那就有可能说明你已经离这门手艺太远了。

**Joanna Lord**  31:34 乔安娜-洛德 31:34

Yeah, I mean, I’ll be really vulnerable on this podcast with you. But I remember once being in a board meeting and being asked a question I should have known the answer to, which was basically, what’s the size of your email database again, and I hadn’t, that team was so good in my life cycle team was so good. I hadn’t really talked to them about that in a while, like, I was focused on these other things. And I prep this whole board deck. And I couldn’t answer that to my board. Like, it’s one of my most significant assets as a consumer marketing company is the size of my audience. So that was embarrassing one, I remember, not only did I had to say, I’ll have to check with my team, which is embarrassing, because we also have a funnel, right? It’s like the number one metric that matters. But two, I had I wrote a note to the board after late that night, just apologizing for not being on top of my metrics. And I just think like, that was a lesson I needed to learn. And I think, by the way, it’s pretty common, that we tend as leaders to put our attention on the fighters, you know, and I usually that lightly, but like, if a team’s doing really well, and you’ve got all stars, you feel pretty good about it, you redirect your energy to an area that needs it more. But you can’t get far from that trade. I can’t not know what’s going on with the size of our database, and how are we accelerating our ability to convert those leads and those sorts of things? So just an example, a really honest example of a time I really missed up, you know, it’s took a big misstep. Yeah,  

是的，我的意思是，在播客中我会很脆弱。但我记得有一次在董事会上，我被问到了一个我本该知道答案的问题，基本上就是，你的电子邮件数据库有多大。我已经很久没跟他们讨论过这个问题了，我一直专注于其他事情。我还准备了这一整套板子我无法向我的董事会回答这个问题。作为一家消费者营销公司，我最重要的资产之一就是我的受众规模。我记得，那是很尴尬的一件事，我不仅得说，我得跟我的团队确认一下，这很尴尬，因为我们也有一个漏斗，对吧？这就像是头号重要指标。其次，那天深夜，我给董事会写了张便条，为我没有掌握好指标而道歉。我只是觉得，这是我需要吸取的教训。我觉得，顺便说一句，这很常见，作为领导者，我们往往会把注意力放在战士身上，你知道的，我通常也是这么想的，但就像，如果一个团队做得非常好，你有所有的明星，你会感觉很好，你会把你的精力转移到更需要它的地方。但你不能远离交易。我不能不知道我们的数据库规模发生了什么变化，我们如何加快转化这些潜在客户的能力，以及诸如此类的事情？所以，我只是举个例子，一个真正诚实的例子，一次我真的错过了，你知道，这是一个很大的失误。是啊、

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  32:53  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 32:53

that’s a great example. And thank you for sharing that I think all of these things. I mean, they solidify our vision of what the role should be, and what our careers should be about. So I think all of these are super important parts of the growing journey. And on this journey, you’ve hired a lot of people. And so one thing that I’m super curious about is having hired so many people seen when things work really, really well, when there are mismatches and seeing everything in between. What do you now look for in people, when you bring people onto your team? What are the things that you’ve learned that really make a difference?  

这是一个很好的例子。谢谢你的分享，我认为所有这些事情。我的意思是，它们巩固了我们对角色和职业的愿景。所以，我认为这些都是成长历程中超级重要的部分。在这个过程中，你雇佣了很多人。我非常好奇的一件事是，在雇佣了这么多人之后，你看到了什么时候工作会非常非常顺利，什么时候会出现不匹配的情况，也看到了介于两者之间的所有情况。现在，当你带人加入团队时，你会看重哪些方面？你学到了哪些真正起作用的东西？

**Joanna Lord**  33:30 乔安娜-洛德 33:30

Yeah, I was actually reflecting on this the other day, because like, you get into these roles, and you hire teams. And I think most managers and leaders are probably most proud of their teams, like, the teams I built are even more beautiful than the mark work in marketing I’ve done. But I’ve hired a lot of people like 1000s of marketers, which means I’ve been in probably close to, I don’t even know 10,000 interviews, if you think about  

是啊，其实我前几天也在反思这个问题，因为就像你进入这些角色，你会雇佣团队。我想大多数管理者和领导者最引以为豪的可能就是他们的团队，比如，我所建立的团队甚至比我在市场营销领域所做的标杆性工作还要漂亮。但我雇用过很多人，比如 1000 多名营销人员，这意味着我参加过大概近 1 万次面试，如果你仔细想想的话。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  33:51  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 33:51

it over so many interviews. Yeah.  

它在这么多的采访。是啊

**Joanna Lord**  33:53 乔安娜-洛德 33:53

And I’m very lucky. I’ve worked with some remarkable people teams, and I feel like they’ve really helped me hone how I think about hiring. Obviously, early in my career, I made a bunch of mistakes. I just hired people that were best at the thing I needed in the next six months, right? Like, oh, maybe that’s not the right answer. Maybe you have to think longer term and more holistically. So I have a very high bar on candidates. If you ask anyone that ever worked for me, if you ever read like my recommendations on LinkedIn, my people that have worked for me have managed this. And it’s because I believe there’s the again, kind of back to the book, like there’s the what you do. And there I have a multitude of dimensions I’ve honed over the years when I’m hiring a growth marketer versus a brand marketer versus a product marketer how I think about the skill, but I actually think the more important things to look for when you’re hiring, if you really want to give yourself the best shot at the right hire. There’s kind of three things I look at outside of just what they do, and how well they do it, which is actually an easier thing to vet these days. I think the three softer things. I think there’s a predisposition I look for are they naturally above the line at the line or below the line right And sometimes it’s called optimism or pessimism. I work in high growth tech. If you’re a pessimist, we’re gonna have a hard time I ensure your teams are not going to want to work with you. People love pragmatists. Sometimes I love a good curmudgeon. But like for the majority of the time, you need someone who’s like bringing positivity to hard problems, like believing they can’t be solved. So predisposition is an area I bet for  

我很幸运。我曾与一些杰出的团队共事，我觉得他们真的帮我磨练了招聘的思维方式。显然，在我职业生涯的早期，我犯了很多错误。我只是雇佣了那些我在未来六个月内最需要的人，对吗？比如，哦，也许这不是正确的答案。也许你必须考虑得更长远、更全面。所以，我对候选人的要求很高。如果你问任何曾经为我工作过的人，如果你看过我在 LinkedIn 上的推荐，为我工作过的人都能做到这一点。这是因为我相信，回到这本书，就像你做了什么一样。多年来，我在招聘成长型营销人员和品牌营销人员以及产品营销人员时，都会从多个维度来考量他们的技能，但实际上，我认为，如果你真的想给自己最好的机会，找到合适的人选，那么在招聘时，更重要的是要看他们的技能。除了他们所做的工作，以及他们做得有多好之外，我还会看三件事。我认为这三点比较软。我认为有一种倾向性，我会看他们是天生就在线上还是线下，有时这被称为乐观主义或悲观主义。我在高增长的科技领域工作。如果你是个悲观主义者，我们会很难相处，我保证你的团队不会愿意和你共事。人们喜欢实用主义者。有时候，我也喜欢好脾气的人。但在大多数情况下，你需要的是一个能为难题带来积极因素的人，比如相信难题是无法解决的。因此，我认为预设是一个领域

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  35:22  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 35:22

sure. On the predisposition point, that sounds super interesting to me. How do you tease that out? How do you find that out during an interview process?  

当然。关于倾向性这一点，我觉得非常有趣。你是如何发现这一点的？如何在面试过程中发现这一点？

**Joanna Lord**  35:30 乔安娜-洛德 35:30

I think there’s a lot of questions you can ask for this. But I actually think I’m fairly candid in this question, where I kind of say to someone, Listen, can you give me an example of a time you approach to hard, like a hard problem, you sat down with a team and a heart problem was put in front of you? What voice in the room were you? And they’re really because people are proud of this? They’re either I’m the person who brings a super rational pragmatic, should we, you know, is this the right problem we shouldn’t be on? If it’s too hard of a problem, is this the right use of our resources, you can start to vet that they might be a little bit closer to either neutral or pessimist. If they’re like, I like to understand why, you know, this problem seems really interesting. I want to understand all the ways we can solve it, I want to hear everyone else’s voice in the room, then we can evaluate what’s the right way to tackle it, they are already assuming there’s a way to solve it. Right. So I think people are proud of this not bad or good. I just think in high growth companies, a predisposition of optimism, or at least above neutral tends to help like I always say, are you going to be? Are you going to bring an energy into the room that brings us closer to a solution or further from it? And that’s kind of a question that helps you get there.  

我想你可以问很多这样的问题。但实际上，我认为我在这个问题上是相当坦率的，我会对别人说，听着，你能给我举个例子吗？你有一次处理难题，比如一个棘手的问题，你和一个团队坐在一起，一个棘手的问题摆在你面前。你在房间里是什么声音？他们真的因为这个而感到自豪吗？他们要么认为我是一个超级理性务实的人，我们是否应该，你知道，这是不是我们不应该解决的问题？如果这个问题太难，我们是否应该正确使用我们的资源，你可以开始判断他们可能更接近中立或悲观主义者。如果他们喜欢，我想了解为什么，你知道，这个问题看起来真的很有趣。我想了解我们可以解决它的所有方法，我想听听房间里其他人的声音，然后我们可以评估什么是解决它的正确方法，他们已经在假设有一种方法可以解决它。没错。因此，我认为人们对此感到自豪，这不是坏事，也不是好事。我只是觉得，在高增长的公司里，乐观的倾向，或者至少高于中性的倾向，会对公司有帮助，就像我常说的，你会成为这样的人吗？你是要把一种能量带入房间，让我们更接近解决方案，还是离它更远？这就是一个能帮助你实现目标的问题。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  36:35  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 36:35

Such a good question. I’m definitely etching that into my memory from now until forever. That is very good question. Okay. So predisposition, what was number two?  

真是个好问题。我一定会把这个问题从现在一直记到永远。真是个好问题好吧，那么第二点是什么？

**Joanna Lord**  36:44 乔安娜-洛德 36:44

So the second is ego. I think this is probably easier to vet for when you kind of ask someone about what they’re most proud of, you know, do they use the because, again, you’re looking for someone who’s humble, but not just humble, someone who genuinely believes that more people together working on something is superior than one person working on something right like that there’s a benefit to multiple voices have multiple contributions. And the question I simply asked there is, you know, what are you most proud of, and you are just looking for language you’re looking for how they describe it is a lot of like, I’m most proud of the work I did on x is the I’m actually really proud of this campaign that my team did XYZ and I watched them so shine in that project, or like, we discovered a whole new way of doing something. So you’re looking for their predisposition on how they see the world as part of a team or as an individual. Sometimes you want an individual mindset, like some hires you do, and I’ll talk about that in a sec. But like, I think for the majority of the time, and again, high growth tech companies, you really want a humble attitude. And someone who’s just deeply believes, like they have more to learn, they have more to learn. They’re only have one voice. So that tends to be the second dimension. And then the third is mindset. Right? And I think we’ve heard and talked a lot about this in tech, but I’m always vetting for growth or fixed mindset. This is easier to vet for than Well, it’s harder in some roles and easier and others. So I think I manage a lot of creative teams. And I think sometimes they have a fixed mindset, right? Like there’s there are superior better ways to do things. And they’re not necessarily open to a new way of doing things because they’ve been taught a certain way. And so you really have to unpick with this one, is it that they believe there’s more to learn, and they always want to learn it? Or do they believe they’ve like, learned something really well, and they want to bring it to your company? Like you want to make sure you don’t misrepresent fixed mindset. But those are the three things I’m looking for. How are they going to show up? And that’s really the thing I don’t work gets easier if people show up well, and it’s contagious, right? If someone shows up and they’re like, let’s solve this problem, we can do it, you probably can solve the problem. And so those are the things that are I tried to vet for because they’re the they’re the gotchas when you make a hire.  

其次是自我。我认为，当你问一个人他最引以为豪的是什么时，这可能更容易审查，你知道，他们是否使用了 "因为 "这个词，同样，你正在寻找一个谦虚的人，但不仅仅是谦虚，一个真正相信更多的人一起做一件事比一个人做一件事更有意义的人，就像多个声音有多个贡献是有好处的一样。我简单地问的问题是，你知道，你最引以为豪的是什么吗？你只是在寻找语言，你在寻找他们是如何描述的，比如，我最引以为豪的是我在 X 上所做的工作，实际上，我真的为我的团队所做的 XYZ 活动感到骄傲，我看着他们在那个项目中大放异彩，或者说，我们发现了一种全新的做事方式。所以，你要寻找的是他们作为团队一员或个人看待世界的倾向。有时候，你需要的是个人的思维模式，比如有些员工就是这样，我稍后会说到这一点。但是，我认为在大多数情况下，同样是高增长的科技公司，你需要的是一种谦逊的态度。你需要一个态度谦逊的人，一个坚信自己还有很多东西要学的人。他们只有一个声音。因此，这往往是第二个维度。第三个是心态。对不对？我想我们在科技领域已经听过和谈过很多这方面的问题，但我一直在审查成长型或固定型思维模式。这比嗯更容易审查，在某些角色中更难，而在另一些角色中则更容易。我管理过很多创意团队。我觉得有时候他们的思维模式是固定的，对吧？就好像有更好的方法去做事情。 他们不一定愿意接受新的做事方法，因为他们已经被灌输了某种方法。因此，你真的要对这个问题进行分析，是他们认为还有更多东西要学，而且他们一直想学？还是他们认为自己已经学到了非常好的东西，并想把它带到你的公司？就像你要确保你不会歪曲固定思维模式一样。这就是我要找的三样东西。他们会如何表现出来？如果人们表现得很好，我的工作就会变得轻松，而这是会传染的，对吗？如果有人来了，他们会说，让我们来解决这个问题吧，我们能做到，你也许也能解决这个问题。所以，这些都是我试图审查的东西，因为他们是他们是你做一个招聘的棘手问题。

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  38:53  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 38:53

Yeah, that’s super well explained. But also it just shows you know how deeply you’ve thought about this stuff. This is not something that you’re coming up with on the fly. This is like the combination, the cumulative knowledge and experience of like you said that hiring 1000s of people so super valuable. The one phrase I heard from other guests we had on this show was it was funny the way that he said it, it was I only worked with people who have a bounce in their step as they’re walking into the building. That was, that was awesome. So on the last one I knew mindset, again, is probably one of the things that people talk about more, but I am curious, how do you evaluate that in an interview setting?  

是啊，解释得太好了。同时也说明你对这些东西的思考有多深。这不是你临时想出来的。这就像你说的，雇佣了上千人的知识和经验的结合，所以超级有价值。我在节目中听到其他嘉宾说过一句话，他说的方式很有趣，那就是我只和那些走进大楼时脚步有弹性的人共事。这真是太棒了。关于最后一个问题，我知道心态可能是人们谈论较多的问题之一，但我很好奇，你在面试中是如何评估心态的？

**Joanna Lord**  39:34 乔安娜-洛德 39:34

Yeah, I mean, I think for mindset, you can kind of ask softer questions around things like what do you do with your free time? And oftentimes, it’d be like, in this is just one signal, but if they’re doing hobbies that are expanding their mind, like, Oh, I’m actually learning a new language right now or I’m trying a whole new hobby and you know, or I recently got into baking bread because one of my friends said it’s mint for staying like so I think there’s a where they spend their time outside of work that usually can show you a signal one of many signals. I think the second thing is just you ask them, what’s the last thing you learned? And what in how did you learn it? And if they really struggle with that question doesn’t mean they are always a fixed mindset. But it usually means it like, someone could listen to new podcasts and tell me that they learned something off that podcast that shows growth mindset, they took the initiative to listen to a podcast. So I think there’s like those softer questions.  

是的，我的意思是，我认为对于思维方式，你可以问一些比较柔和的问题，比如你的空闲时间都做些什么？很多时候，这就像，这只是一个信号，但如果他们正在做的爱好正在扩展他们的思维，就像，哦，我现在实际上正在学习一门新的语言，或者我正在尝试一个全新的爱好，你知道，或者我最近开始烤面包，因为我的一个朋友说这是保持喜欢的薄荷，所以我认为有一个他们花他们的工作以外的时间，通常可以向你展示一个信号的许多信号之一。我觉得第二件事就是问他们，你学到的最后一件事是什么？你是怎么学会的？如果他们真的在这个问题上挣扎，并不意味着他们总是固定思维模式。但这通常意味着，有人可能会听新的播客，并告诉我他们从那个播客中学到了一些东西，这就说明他们有成长型思维，他们主动去听播客。因此，我认为有一些问题比较柔和。I again, Aiden, I like to ask the obvious question, hey, you know, in the world of growth mindset, or fixed mindset, like where have you found yourself on that spectrum?  

同样，艾登，我喜欢问一个显而易见的问题，嘿，你知道，在成长型思维模式和固定型思维模式的世界里，你发现自己处于哪个阶段？ Because I think a lot of people when they say they’ll, they’ll almost always say, I believe in a growth mindset. Well, give me some examples of that. It’s like they go blank. And so I think, you know, people, people will tell you in interviews, their best answer, and I think asking the obvious question isn’t always the wrong question to ask, you know,  

因为我觉得很多人在说他们会的时候，几乎都会说，我相信成长型思维模式。好吧，给我举几个例子。这就像他们去空白。所以我认为，你知道，人们在接受采访时会告诉你他们的最佳答案，我认为问一个显而易见的问题并不总是一个错误的问题，你知道的、

**Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app)**  40:54  

Aydin Mirzaee (Fellow.app) 40:54

yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And asking for the examples is, where you really, really start to dig in. John, this has been an awesome interview, we’ve talked about so many different topics started with EQ, I loved your 100% true test, that is awesome. And, and also the job description and voting against that managing the small stuff, because that will become the big stuff. I love the discussion we had around focusing on your craft and never losing focus of what it is that you’re there to do. And your hiring rubric is awesome. I feel like a lot of people will take notes to get it published somewhere. Yeah, it does need to get published. I’m glad that you were able to share that lots of really, really good tips there the question of what voice in the room? Were you? That’s such a brilliant question. It’s so awesome. So thank you for sharing all of that. The final question that we always like to end on with our guests is for all the managers and leaders constantly looking to get better at their craft. Are there any final tips, tricks or words of wisdom that you would leave them with?  

是的，这很有道理。举例说明，这才是你真正开始深入研究的地方。约翰，这是一次很棒的访谈，我们聊了很多不同的话题，从情商开始，我喜欢你的百分百真实测试，这太棒了。还有工作描述，以及投票反对管理小事，因为小事会变成大事。我喜欢我们围绕 "专注于你的技艺 "和 "永远不要忘记你的工作是什么 "展开的讨论。你的招聘标准非常棒。我觉得很多人都会做笔记，以便在某个地方发表。是啊，确实需要发表。我很高兴你能分享很多非常非常好的建议，房间里有什么声音？是你吗？这是个很好的问题太棒了谢谢你的分享。最后一个问题，我们总是喜欢以嘉宾的问题作为结尾，这个问题是针对所有不断追求更好的管理者和领导者的。您最后有什么建议、技巧或智慧之言要留给他们吗？

**Joanna Lord**  41:56 乔安娜-洛德 41:56

Yeah, I mean, I would say, you know, call me we’ll chat. It’s such a hard journey. Like I really I genuinely empathize. And I still remember how hard those first couple roles can be. And sometimes, even today, what how hard some days can be as a leader, I guess my best advice is, get to know yourself. And I said a little bit earlier, but how you are as a leader is basically who you are as a human. And if you don’t know, what you’re scared of, you don’t know what makes you tick, or what you’re motivated by, if you can’t speak to your strengths and your weaknesses, if you can’t respect yourself, but also know what you don’t know. Like, if you don’t do that work, it will be very hard to show up and help others do that work. And when I say very hard, absolutely impossible. So I think my tip is get you know, whatever that personal work is like getting to know who you are and why you love what you love. I’d start that journey, therapy, meditation, coaching mentorship, having healthy friends and talking about these things. I just start that journey, because I really believe that like great leaders just couldn’t connect with their teams on a very human level. And that’s hard to do. If you haven’t done that work.  

是啊，我的意思是，我会说，你知道， 打电话给我，我们会聊天。这是一个艰难的旅程。我真的感同身受我还记得最初的几个角色有多难。有时，即使在今天，作为一个领导者，有些日子也会很难熬，我想我最好的建议就是，了解你自己。我之前说过，作为一名领导者，你的为人基本上就是你的为人。如果你不知道你害怕什么，你不知道是什么让你心动，或者你的动机是什么，如果你不能说出你的长处和短处，如果你不能尊重自己，但也要知道你不知道什么。比如，如果你不做这些工作，你就很难出现并帮助别人做这些工作。我说的 "很难 "是指绝对不可能。所以，我觉得我的建议是，不管你的个人工作是什么，都要了解你是谁，你为什么喜欢你所喜欢的。我会开始这段旅程，治疗、冥想、教练指导、拥有健康的朋友并谈论这些事情。我刚刚开始这段旅程，因为我真的相信，伟大的领导者就是无法在人性化的层面上与他们的团队建立联系。这很难做到。如果你没有做这项工作。
