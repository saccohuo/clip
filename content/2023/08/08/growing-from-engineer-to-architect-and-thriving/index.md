This article is the next edition of “Which is the right engineering career path for you?”. This edition is particularly made for engineers to make good decisions regarding their career growth. Knowing in which direction to grow, will ensure you focus on learning the right things.  

本文是 "哪条才是适合你的工程职业道路？本版特别针对工程师的职业发展做出正确的决定。了解自己的职业发展方向，将确保你集中精力学习正确的知识。

We are now moving towards the mindset and mentality of being an architect. When growing to the architect position it’s important to understand that you have a much bigger impact with your technical leadership and enabling others, than just your own contribution.  

我们现在正在向架构师的思维和心态转变。在成长为架构师的过程中，重要的是要明白，你的技术领导力和对他人的帮助比你自己的贡献要大得多。

I’ve had the pleasure to interview Mike Thornton, Software Architect at Bluebeam. He has over 20 years of experience both as an engineer growing all the way to Principal level and as a Software Architect enabling various teams to be productive and successful.  

我有幸采访了 Bluebeam 的软件架构师 Mike Thornton。他拥有超过 20 年的工作经验，从一名工程师一直成长为首席工程师，同时也是一名软件架构师，帮助各个团队取得了丰硕的成果。

We have talked about his overall motivation, typical day (week), how to tell that an engineer would be a great architect, his advice on what actions to take to grow to the architect position, tips for first-time architects, and how to improve knowledge as an architect.  

我们讨论了他的总体动机、典型的一天（一周）、如何判断一个工程师会是一个出色的建筑师、他对成长为建筑师所应采取的行动的建议、给初次成为建筑师的人的建议以及如何提高作为建筑师的知识水平。

My path to becoming a Software Architect started as a different type of architect. I was interested in building architecture and got my first real job as a drafter at an architectural firm. I was learning home design.  

我的软件架构师之路是从另一种类型的架构师开始的。我对建筑设计很感兴趣，并在一家建筑设计公司找到了第一份真正意义上的绘图员工作。我当时正在学习家居设计。

Then, unexpectedly, I took over the firm's house plan website since I was good with computers and had done some basic programming. I then realized I liked software more than buildings.  

后来，我意外地接手了公司的房屋规划网站，因为我擅长电脑，也做过一些基本的编程工作。后来我意识到，比起建筑，我更喜欢软件。

While my path changed, it wasn't as big a leap as it may seem. Software and building architecture both require a deep understanding and passion for the principles of design, architecture, mentoring, and project planning.  

虽然我的人生道路发生了变化，但这并不像看起来那么大的飞跃。软件和建筑架构都需要对设计、架构、指导和项目规划的原则有深刻的理解和热情。

Throughout my software development career, I've always thought about the big picture and how the small part I'm working on fits within in. That eagerness to understand the big picture — to get more context — is what set me on the path of Software Architecture.  

在我的软件开发生涯中，我一直在思考全局，以及我正在开发的小部分是如何融入其中的。这种渴望了解全局--获得更多背景信息--的愿望让我走上了软件架构之路。

There isn't a singular definition of an architect role, so I'll clarify how I consider my role, which will put some context to what my day looks like.  

建筑师的角色并没有一个统一的定义，因此我将说明我是如何看待我的角色的，这将为我一天的工作提供一些背景资料。

In my experience, architects work to understand customer need, business need, and developer need in order to create a technical strategy to serve them holistically.  

根据我的经验，架构师的工作是了解客户需求、业务需求和开发人员需求，从而制定技术战略，为他们提供全面服务。

As an architect, I focus on enabling cross-team collaboration and facilitating development processes. This can result in a lot of non-linear activities. I track architectural initiatives as Visionary, Strategic, or Tactical. So some things are one-off tasks, whereas other things require small consistent effort over long time periods.  

作为一名架构师，我的工作重点是实现跨团队协作和促进开发流程。这可能会导致很多非线性活动。我将架构计划分为愿景型、战略型和战术型。因此，有些事情是一次性任务，而另一些事情则需要长时间的持续努力。

So I don't really have a typical work day. Instead, I can talk about some of the various things I might do in a week, in no particular order.  

因此，我并没有一个典型的工作日。相反，我可以谈谈我一周可能做的各种事情，排名不分先后。

-   Help an engineer with a design by talking through their solution.  
    
    通过讨论工程师的解决方案，帮助他们完成设计。
    
-   Host a meeting with stakeholders to align on requirements for a new feature.  
    
    与利益相关者召开会议，就新功能的要求达成一致。
    
-   Review code from a high level — is it satisfying the acceptance criteria?  
    
    从高层次审查代码--是否符合验收标准？

    与产品团队沟通，直觉检查功能的技术可行性。
    
-   Track down who is the subject matter expert on something to help another engineer on a design.  
    
    追踪谁是某方面的主题专家，以帮助其他工程师进行设计。
    
-   Host a meeting with Principal Engineers to share best practices.  
    
    与首席工程师举行会议，分享最佳做法。

-   Open a pull request for a Decision Record.  
    
    打开决策记录的拉取请求。
    

You might see a lot of meetings and working with documents. My goal is to have effective communication between teams to keep development and deployment streams moving smoothly. Sometimes this means getting on Zoom, sometimes updating a document, or sometimes a quick Slack chat. Occasionally, I will write code.  

你可能会看到很多会议和文档工作。我的目标是在团队之间进行有效沟通，以保持开发和部署流程的顺利进行。有时这意味着上 Zoom，有时意味着更新文档，有时意味着在 Slack 上快速聊天。偶尔，我会编写代码。

Writing code is no longer my focus. Making it easier for everyone else to deliver with code is now my focus.  

编写代码不再是我的工作重点。现在我的工作重点是让其他人更轻松地交付代码。

I can tell an engineer will be a good architect if they're always seeking more context and ways to improve the design of the system.  

如果一个工程师总是在寻找更多的背景和方法来改进系统设计，我就能看出他是一个优秀的建筑师。

I can tell they will be a great architect if they're interested in improving the broader system — the end-to-end software ecosystem.  

如果他们对改进更广泛的系统--端到端软件生态系统--感兴趣，我就知道他们会成为一名出色的架构师。

The ecosystem includes not only software processes but also processes run by people. It encompasses customers, the business, developers, customer support, quality assurance, software, infrastructure, development pipelines, product delivery, and more. Not just improving what solutions we develop but why and how we develop them.  

生态系统不仅包括软件流程，还包括由人运行的流程。它包括客户、业务、开发人员、客户支持、质量保证、软件、基础设施、开发管道、产品交付等。不仅要改进我们开发的解决方案，还要改进我们开发的原因和方式。

I see this interest start as a kernel of initiative. I see it when an engineer cares more about why they're building something than they do about building it. Why are we building this feature? How does it solve the customer's needs? How does it solve the company's needs?  

我将这种兴趣视为主动性的内核。当工程师更关心他们为什么要建造某样东西，而不是建造它的时候，我就会看到这种兴趣。我们为什么要开发这个功能？它如何解决客户的需求？如何解决公司的需求？

Another sign is if they care about why the company builds things the way they do. Software development is a team effort and requires coordination with a lot of non-technical components. A developer that cares about making development processes smoother, faster, and easier could grow into an architecture role.  

另一个标志是，他们是否关心公司为什么要这样做。软件开发是一项团队工作，需要与许多非技术部门进行协调。如果开发人员关心如何让开发流程更顺畅、更快速、更轻松，那么他就可以成长为一名架构师。

Endeavor to get more context and take on more responsibility.  

努力了解更多情况，承担更多责任。

Try to learn more about why a change needs to be made. What pain is the customer experiencing? Why does the company need this fixed more than some other change? How does this change impact the customer, the business, and the developers?  

尝试进一步了解为什么需要做出改变。客户正在经历什么痛苦？为什么公司更需要这一变更而不是其他变更？这一变更对客户、企业和开发人员有什么影响？

Shift your work towards force multiplying efforts:  

将你的工作转向倍增力量的努力：

-   Framework or library development 框架或图书馆开发
    
-   Debugging a complex problem that is blocking other developers  
    
    调试阻碍其他开发人员的复杂问题
    
-   Mentoring others with their design or reviewing designs  
    
    指导他人设计或审查设计
    
-   Reviewing code to teach 回顾代码教学
    
-   Grooming the backlog 梳理积压工作
    
-   Research and developing proofs of concept  
    
    研究和开发概念验证
    
-   Defining best practices 确定最佳做法
    
-   Improving performance 提高绩效
    
-   Refactoring to illustrate best practices  
    
    重构以说明最佳做法
    

Rather than waiting for someone to notice your efforts, talk with your manager. Let them know you want to take on more of these types of efforts and get more context.  

与其等待别人注意到你的努力，不如与你的经理谈谈。让他们知道你想承担更多此类工作，并获得更多背景信息。

As I've mentioned, architecture is about having a broad context. So focus on getting that context and building connections so you can be a conduit for context.  

正如我所提到的，建筑就是要有广泛的背景。因此，要专注于获取背景并建立联系，这样你才能成为背景的传播者。

If you're joining a new company as an architect, learn as much as you can about the current processes and practices before suggesting change. You will need to build relations with many people in many departments. You, by nature, will be working with many teams.  

如果你以架构师的身份加入一家新公司，在提出变革建议之前，要尽可能多地了解当前的流程和实践。你需要与许多部门的许多人建立关系。从本质上讲，你将与许多团队合作。

One way I like to get to know the teams and their processes is to work with them for a week to get a commit merged and deployed to production. To do this, I ask each team to onboard me as if I'm a new developer. I can't spend a lot of time and don't want to be a burden, so the task should be small and non-critical. It could be as simple as resizing a UI component or fixing a log message.  

我喜欢了解团队及其流程的一种方式是与他们合作一周，将提交合并并部署到生产环境中。为此，我要求每个团队都把我当作新开发人员。我不能花很多时间，也不想成为他们的负担，所以任务应该是小而非关键的。任务可以很简单，比如调整用户界面组件的大小或修复一条日志信息。

From the exercise, I'll learn a lot about the team including how work is planned, what the team structure is, what tech stack they use, what the pull request process is, what testing procedures there are, what the deployment model is, what the product does, etc. If the team has excellent onboarding practices, this should be a breeze. If not, then you'll learn how you can help improve the process in the future. The most important part is to start building connections with the teams.  

从演练中，我会了解到团队的很多情况，包括工作是如何计划的、团队结构是怎样的、他们使用什么技术栈、拉取请求流程是怎样的、有哪些测试程序、部署模式是怎样的、产品是做什么的，等等。如果团队有很好的入职培训实践，这应该是轻而易举的。如果没有，那么你将了解到如何在将来帮助改进流程。最重要的是开始与团队建立联系。

If you're promoted within a company, then do the opposite. There is a tendency to promote from one role to another yet still expect the same type of output from the old role. If you are coding, get out of the critical path of feature development as quickly as possible. If you continue to code features, you will become a bottleneck. You'll have a hard time facilitating software development if you're knee-deep in it yourself.  

如果你在公司内部得到晋升，那么就要反其道而行之。有一种趋势是，你从一个角色晋升到另一个角色，却仍然期望从原来的角色获得相同类型的产出。如果你正在编写代码，请尽快脱离功能开发的关键路径。如果你继续编码功能，就会成为瓶颈。如果你自己也深陷其中，就很难促进软件开发。

Even if you've been with the company a long time, there are things at a high level you might not have been aware of yet. As you take on new projects, embrace your role and ask for more context than you might have before. Start building relationships with stakeholders and developers to see what their needs are and how you can facilitate them.  

即使你在公司工作了很长时间，有些高层次的事情你可能还没有意识到。当你接手新项目时，要接受自己的角色，并询问比以前更多的背景情况。开始与利益相关者和开发人员建立关系，了解他们的需求以及你能如何满足他们的需求。

One fun thing architects do as part of normal work is build proofs of concept. If the company is interested in adopting a new technology, build a POC. It's a great way to assess the technology as well as keep your skills fresh.  

作为日常工作的一部分，建筑师会做的一件有趣的事情就是构建概念验证。如果公司有兴趣采用一项新技术，就构建一个 POC。这是评估技术和保持技能新鲜度的好方法。

Keep seeking context. Read technical newsletters, blogs, and books. Follow tech leaders on social media platforms like LinkedIn.  

不断寻找背景。阅读技术通讯、博客和书籍。在 LinkedIn 等社交媒体平台上关注技术领袖。

Then take it a step further. Write about what you're doing. Writing has a way of making you rethink what you know. It helps you reframe your thoughts and translate them so others can understand them. This is a crucial skill for communicating with all levels of your teams.  

然后再进一步。写下你正在做的事情。写作能让你重新思考你所知道的。它可以帮助你重构自己的想法，并将其转化为他人可以理解的内容。这是与各级团队沟通的重要技巧。

Seek out mentors and be a mentor. Both have helped me immensely.  

寻找导师，成为导师。这两者都给了我极大的帮助。

As a highly technical person, I've rarely needed help with the technology side of things. However, architecture is more about soft skills than hard skills. Mentors have helped me better understand the business side of things. They helped me with communication skills. They gave me the context I was missing.  

作为一个技术性很强的人，我很少需要技术方面的帮助。然而，与硬技能相比，架构更需要软技能。导师们帮助我更好地理解业务方面的事情。他们帮助我掌握沟通技巧。他们给了我所缺少的背景知识。

I've always mentored other engineers with technical skills like coding and debugging. Now I'm helping them with soft skills. As I do, I get better myself.  

我一直指导其他工程师学习编码和调试等技术技能。现在，我正在帮助他们掌握软技能。这样做的同时，我自己也在不断进步。
