All right everybody welcome back to another episode of the productivity like a pro podcast I'm so excited with my co-host and friend Paco cantero welcome back to the show today we have a really exciting topic we want to talk about I'm sure many of you are struggling with digital not taking in the business world and uh today we will talk a lot about this we will talk about that there is a difference between shallow and deep Thinking and that are different tools that you should use for your not taking so I think there are a lot of things that we will discuss today that surprise many just seeking for the one and only tool so Paco welcome to the show let's go hi Tom hello everybody so happy to be here to discuss about this deep topic I could say although we will be a little bit shallow okay so that people don't get annoyed and don't get confused because we are pragmatic we want things That really work for busy professionals as we are and I'm ready to go I don't know how we can start talking about this maybe starting take in process I don't know yeah we can we can talk about the the common thing that we see on social media the question what is the best not taking app oh well yeah that's and usually then people answer single worded like Evernote notion and so on but if you go to the website Payless movement.com and you check out tools That Paco and I use then you will see several not taking apps there and I think that's what we need to explain though I know that many busy professionals using Apple notes as well for not take for meeting notes but we also use clickup for no taking so all these things we will reveal in this in this podcast and also let's talk about what's the difference between deep and shallow thinking then yeah I think that that's the most important Point okay Because well I I love to to see see the engagements whenever someone ask on social media what's the best not taking up and then people throw quickly to the reply and there are discussions and there are people talking about I don't know notion with Apple notes with I don't know Tana it's a it's a mess there are people who put habit trackers well everything everything because the moment that you are putting something into a system you are already writing or not Taking you know here everything gets confused because it's a saying a m know that something I want to be remembered I don't know something I want to think about an idea something an image I graph everything becomes chaotic and everything merges that's why we always always try to split the things so that by splitting the things and the concepts people get a better understanding of the things I think that it's pretty important to separate the two main Worlds inside iore information and action and then when talking about information we love to split again into deep thinking and shallow thinking because it's not the same if I'm preparing a blog post it's not the same as if I'm jotting down notes in a meeting or I just want to get remember about something and shallow thinking refers to that type of thinking moment you use your brain for things that you don't really need to dedicate a lot of Time to think about it that's the the the com set okay it's much better defined in our courses okay but I want just want to be uh and use common language so people get the point whenever you don't go deep is not a something that you need to be focused on something that you just want to write it down because you're in a meeting or you are somewhere and you get to to write that thing down so that you can go back and retrieve that information at any Moment that's shallow thinking and that's why we can start creating a classification inside the note taking apps world or the not taking software because you will see that based on these brain these brain processes then you can start understanding why makes more sense to use one type of software instead of all the one because when you move to deep thinking that's just the opposite deep thinking is when you need to really understand something that it's complex When it's you need to go really deep into a thought when you want to deliver something that needs to be focused talking about the the time and the the brain process that you are using and separating those two two type of brain processes I think that brings Clarity okay to start the Journey of not taking and moving into the PKM world for instance I think what also needs to be mentioned here is another concept that we talk about in I core is the single Source of truth because this also means that there are different information types and now you talked about deep thinking and shallow thinking but if you look at the piece of information that you try to collect or to capture um these different types of information get stored in different places so when we say single source of truth it's the same Principle as people say I'm looking for the best taking app and this will be the one app to collect everything people Also get the misconception that the single source of Truth is just one single source of truth that you try to build which is essentially your productivity system end to endend will be your ultimate single source of truth but it is split into separate single source of truths even within the same tool you could see it the same way so for example uh let's say for clickup that I mentioned in the beginning when we take meeting notes There might be a piece of information that's relevant for the whole team so therefore I go to the relevant task where I collect this information for everybody to see there's no point that everybody writes this down in their own notebooks and then sit together again and say oh what did you write up last time and and try to make meeting minutes afterwards no just go directly to the task write down what was discussed and agreed on and therefore this task Becomes the single source of Truth for the topic that was discussed in the meeting and I think from there we start to understand better where to place down things so now going back to shallow thinking and deep thinking you think again a bit in a bigger picture where you say shallow thinking what is my single source of Truth for shallow thinking content there might be different tools for your shallow Thinking because in one you're just collecting websites and the other one you're just taking meeting minutes so this is two different types of shallow thinking that you do there but by understanding that there are differences of different types of nodes that's that's really the key element here to move forward yes and also you can trust on techniques because there are different techniques for instance one that I love it's called outlining Okay people think that an outliner is just bullets and that's it but outlining goes further and in fact there are specific tools that are based on in outlining and that's pretty important okay because it depends on the way you because also trying to reply to the question what's the best not taking up it depends it depends on for what it depends on how your brain works it depends or your circumstances and because maybe if I'm on mobile I use a Certain note taking app and if I'm on desktop I can use another one so it doesn't make any sense to trying to reply to that question the point is how can I capture information without any friction effortlessly and how can I easily retrieve it whenever I may need it I think that that's the the the really question that people should reply or or or that's the answer that people wants to to achieve and that doesn't come from that question okay that Becomes from thinking around the brain processes and then thinking about the different situations that you are facing on a daily basis for instance if you are going to meetings and you have an iPad how do I get the information there that's something that gives you answers okay because the moment that you interact with an application that doesn't work properly on in an iPad you got the answer okay then you need to find something if you go back to desktop And you want to retrieve those meeting notes that you made effortlessly quickly make searches then it gives you another point of view so I think that maybe we can start sharing how we work on these different scenarios because I think that most of our members who are busy professionals as ourselves are looking for Clear answers and we know that people are looking for tools okay how they are focused on the how but we think that this little introduction about the Comet and now we will see the different workflows that we Define and then how we Implement them in the different tools because it's pretty straightforward you can see it on iore framework that we have perfectly defined the the tools that we use for these processes and I think that most of the different scenarios that we Face are the ones that our listeners are facing constantly on a daily basis it's very important to point out that you have to look at this from a Tool agnostic perspective and when I see sometimes comments on YouTube that people say you're switching tools again and I I now I need to use this tool as well or I just started using the tool that you recommended three years ago now you're suddenly changing the tool that's really important then that whenever we change a tool which is actually very rarely that we switching tool in our own systems doesn't mean that we are not reviewing new tools but always from the Perspective of the tools that we already use but for us it's very easy to switch a tool when we decide it works for a specific feature better because these tool agnostic workflows is what we are moving to the next tool so the tool is just a shell where we have everything in there and then we just move on now we could discuss how you migrate the information into the next tool and so on however that that's not really the problem the thing is and the other thing Is that people might think we are switching tools is that we are talking about several tools when it comes to not taking and that's why it's now important to talk about what tools do we use because it's several tools that we use and it we are not switching between these tools they all have a specific purpose and now obviously people want to know what tools they are but it's important to to say that these tools are the tools that we use Paco and I at the Paperless movement for the specific business and it is not the set of tools that all our members use as well that's the beauty if you go into our membership you will see all these IO Frameworks from all our members who are sharing what not taking apps they are using and that might look completely different because they have different use cases and this is where we see the confirmation that what we teach actually works that people understand Ah that's What I need I don't have to we release the pressure that I don't have to use the tool that we recommend or anybody else recommends on YouTube but they would will pick the tools that work best for their specific use case and for our specific use case our current setup is reader tana and heab base that's in the PKM area of the io framework and then we could also say bkm which is business Knowledge Management is the clickup where we also have no taking but let's Stick with the reader Tana HEPA base because this explains best the the workflow from shallow to deep thinking right P so yes um because I think that there's also a differentiation that we need to to make that it's the process of capturing things from the outer World okay things that You' find somewhere and you want to capture restore and retrieve and your own thoughts I think that there is where the mess begins okay because people people get confused even Ourselves because there are a lot of overlapping between the different tools and that's something we need to understand you know the software companies tends to deliver features okay as beasts to try to grab as many people as possible as many clients as possible and then the overlapping thing appears emerges and then people get confused because there are workflows that you can implement in different tools and that's where the chaos begins and I think that At that moment the most important thing is trying to reduce the number of app apps to the most okay and being understanding okay that every tool no matter what the software company says are specific for a certain use cases and they try to overd deliver but that usually it's done in the wrong way I mean because it's not easy to cover such a huge number of features perfectly okay and there are tools that are specific for a certain features and for other They have weaknesses and that's the most important point to detect the strength of each app and then create a parallelism between your workflows the ones that you run inside your brain and the strength of each tool and that's what we have done okay H now that we are going to share for instance how we start the shallow thinking system in our case is using Tana okay because especially in my in my case okay I think like an outliner it was a technique that I Learned a long time ago I I use many tools the one I stick the most was workflow it was a tool that I used for years okay that's why we don't change tools from one month to the other we are talking about years okay until there's something that we consider that it's much better and whenever we find a shiny tool or a shiny new object it's something that we immediately compare with the current tool stack and then we see the weaknesses and the strength and It's pretty easy to decide if the current tool stack is better or worse than the new tool or maybe if that tool it works really well in a specific use case or a feature because for instance there are tools that are specifically designed to capture things on mobile you can use it for that use case and then keep using the the current uh tool stack I think that people when face the the the world of software they try to be one or zero black or white I use this or That and no it's by trying to find complimentary tools how you can run your workf flows pretty smoothly and I think that that's one of the most most important things I just like to add there that if you're struggling if you're just getting started then I would recommend to actually try to force the things into one tool which you probably do already but realize then where are the friction points what type of information you struggle with taking Notes in this tool like you know you you have a tool and you feel very well when you have a deep thinking process when you have a complex problem and you try to manage this and and figure things out it works very well but then you realize but meeting notes man I really struggle I have a lot of friction opening up the tool taking the notes trying to share it then with the team and same things like that so this is where you realize the friction so you have a specific use case Within the tool where you now can look outside and see if there is any other tool that is specialized in for example meeting notes that makes it easy to retrieve easy to share or even use the existing systems in your business for that so this is the is it then the button up approach I would say I don't know if you can say it in this context as well but yeah so start with one tool not try to figure out okay I use this set of tools and then it makes Everything sense then you will fail again because you will get overwhelmed with all these features it's just the incremental steps that you do slowly to adjust your system so start with one tool see where the wall comes that you hit that you cannot get that gives you the friction and then look for the next tool I think that uh squeezing a tool is one of the most beautiful things because you start Bing and double down on different use cases different scenarios Different situations and you see that sooner or later you're going to find friction no matter what the software company is telling you you will see that that doesn't work and maybe it's just because we have to understand that we are individuals okay people who each of us think differently and maybe the way that the software company thought about the workflow that people will follow that process is totally different than the one that you are uh following just By using your brain or because of your situation or maybe because even your company is telling you that you can only use a certain type of tool or or whatever there are many reasons in our case as I was saying Tana is the one that works best because for me anything that I think okay because I'm talking about a storing and capturing my own thoughts that's pretty important okay because talking about content from the outer world for me and for us okay at The paperless movement it's reader okay from readwise I know that it's confusing for for people okay because this company that is called rewise has two different products one it's rwise and the other one is to reader they're going to try to merge both products but for me reader it's amazing okay because it's directly connect with uh readwise readwise helps you stor highlights okay things that you using reader can highlight okay and then they are connected to readwise and that Way using readwise you can practice space repetition okay because you go into the app for instance I every day and every day I'm reviewing all the highlights that I have done so you can the workflow is pretty straightforward okay because it's pretty easy to capture things on reader no matter if you are on desktop or or mobile okay you can capture a tweet you can capture an article you can capture whatever you you may imagine any highlights right correct Kindle highlights medium article because it's connected to medium for instance imagine all of them I think that they have become a standard okay and they did I highly recommend to read the the manifesto okay that they did long time ago when they started uh developing reader because it explains all the friction that all the users are suffering when navigating on the Internet or how we go through information User our mobile devices and It's amazing because the moment that you capture something then you can start consuming that content and at that moment whenever you see something that resonates with you you highlight and that's it send automatically not only to read wise okay to later on practice the space repetition uh process that I have just described but also to a lot and a lot of PKM tools like hease like Tana like obsidian like well a huge bunch(堆) of tools I think the other they I thought They they made that recently with what was the name is the competitor of atabase it's scal okay scintel they have made also the connection so in your PKM tool okay the tool that we will talk in a minute and the tool that you use to convert information into knowledge okay then you are receiving action or what do you mean no I mean information into knowledge because you can evolve that highlight for instance using your own thoughts and Then you create the knowledge and if you decide to move forward we will explain later on uh the workflow that we use but the point is that just having read and t t for my own thoughts for the meeting for instance when I go to a meeting for me is quite straightforward to because bullets and outliners for me are are great okay it it helps my process of quick thinking okay yes to give a little structure and that's it it that's the beginning of everything and with that You got the information in your system and now it's the moment of of processing it after you have capture it yeah so we talked a bit unstructured between the different tools now so let's have a let's talk about a specific workflow right you see a Blog Post article and you want to make notes about this blog Post article so what we show also inside the PKM like a pro course and the digital not like a pro course and implementation parts that we show these Workflows in more detail but in general you would save this blog post in reader and in reader you can calmly read this blog post without any distractions of advertising or anything like that so there you take your highlights these highlights get synchronized then to heab base for example and there if you want to have a deep thinking about this topic that this blog post belongs to then you go to heab base and you take then this already condensed information from these Highlights into your deep thinking put it onto a whiteboard and then you connect it with all the other knowledge that you already collected around this content so Tana sits in between this is you mentioned already Tana is for note taking for meeting notes for example but also for drafting out scripts that's where you use Tana for paco right so it's in combination with heab base because heab base is really great and I always try to force the things to do More on heab base I want to really I'm at a point where I try to have this one tool and I see the friction and I always get back to Tana but I still try to to get the most out of heab Base in this case as well but I don't want to clutter up the deep thinking system which is HEPA based then therefore Tana makes more sense than because there you have a different setup to collect information it doesn't hurt if you just collect random thoughts and so on so how do you Do the process to differentiate between tana and heab base to really decide when to move things from heab base back to Tana to work on there and refine things and then back to up base that's I think one use case and when do you actually collect things Inna and then move it forward to epab base what's the process there for you Paco for me uh it's important to say that reader allows people two features or two processes that I think that are pretty interesting One is commenting because you can comment on any highlight that you make you can comment there that that's pretty important because you take advantage of momentum you have read something something pop up in your mind and then you can highlight create the comment and then keep keep working the point is that also you can tag and that's pretty important because tags allows allows us to send that piece of content to what we call a bucket okay a bucket is like a Recipient okay a place where more or less all the things that are in there are related one to each other so that you can go there and and create an imagine for instance I you can create a tag name PKM or not taking or whatever and the moment that you're interested about that you can create a search using plain text okay but you can go to the tag and see all the things that you have saved using that that tag because tagging it's a a a really good technique To connect information between different tools because you are using the same tags the same buckets in the different tools that you are using so for me uh going back to the question that Tom has just asked me it's Crystal Clear when I need to move something to the deep thinking system in our case epas I start outlining when I try to develop a a thinking and the moment that I see and feel that it's becoming so clutter okay I am starting to get lost I I cannot Keep moving things up and down I'm confused it's the moment that I move to epas because epas has something that it's really amazing it's combining text with Visual whiteboards and that's pretty important because there's a moment that we need visual in our lives in our thinking process and that's what I do at that moment I move to atabase create the reference so that everything is connected okay it's just creating an entry on atabase in that card if it's a Card okay that says Tana outline and then I copy and paste the link to Tana so that I create the connection between epab and tana manually no need for automation no need to over complicate the it's pretty quickly I go toas create tan outline boom create the link and then I directly copy and paste everything from the outliner to epab base and then the beautiful thing about that is I can move forward and then use a whiteboard and at that moment I can Start seeing the different comp sets the crer that I use to write the things down and then I create different elements different objects in a white World visually and start putting order into that c things drawing lines putting things up and down but visually and that's one of the most important that I and we found out talking about eptas compared to some other visual Thinking Tools like mirror for instance is that epis creates really well and really nice The text the content that is based on text okay because the moment that you move there every paragraph becomes a block and a block can be converted into a card easily pretty straightforward it seems I know that people who are listening to the podcast can be confused but if they see any of our videos that we have shared about database they will see that it's really really easy that's why one of the reasons why we moved to epab base Uh this year because it's amazing how these guys have thought about the process of combining text and visual elements in a way that you don't need to be nerdy H it's pretty easy pretty straightforward pretty intuitive and the moment that you start working on a whiteboard that's amazing okay because you got lines you got colors you can move things from one card to the other and then you see the whole picture and by the way it's important that although Eptas is not a pure pure outliner but you can work using bullets you can collapse you can create what's the the name of this control I cannot remember you can up and down so you can zoom in and zoom out into the information inside a a paragraph because you can create sections and then you can collapse collapse the sections you can open toggle headers yeah a toggle that's that was it a toggle and and that's pretty important because then you keep Developing your thinking because some of the thing that I do immediately on Tana I create a link to the epas Whiteboard and whatever so that I can for instance create a search in about something and whenever I go there I say oh I created I've created a I don't know long time ago maybe a whiteboard here let's see and then you see how we are moving without any effort any friction and using best features of each application and that's the most important thing Because people from Tana will tell you that they are the best PKM tool and people from atab they will say exactly the same no matter where you are or what you look at they will see because maybe a lot of people they can use just atab or T and they can develop your thinking but for me not having an outliner is a witness and also not having visual thinking at a certain level of thinking it's also a winess so then and it's impossible because going a little bit Deeper why this is why it is is because the way you develop the way they created the application it's dramatically different how you code to develop an outliner and how you code to create something like atabase and that's why it cannot become it's impossible maybe they can do inventions or whatever people from obsidian okay obsidian using plugins they are creating the visual thinking okay they also have plugins to create an outliner but when you compare The outlining experience of obsidian with a a plug-in versus any pure outliner like WorkFlowy like Tana I don't care it's just the compest it's the technique I don't care about the tool it's a huge differ and also when comparing visual tools because even tools that are really amazing talking about visual like mirror when you compare the visual features of epas versus the visual feat of miror miror wins the battle without any doubt but The point is that for that thinking process that you don't need you just need a little bit of visual features they have distilled that that's the most important thing about epab base they have been distilling features from crucial tools like for instance mirror Rome or notion and they have just created something that for certain workflows work really really well and really nice and I think that that's pretty Important yeah yeah you pointed out something very important there as well that's I mentioned that I try to force the things to heab base but I realized also something working in T is working with long form text so whenever you try to write a blog post for example in Tana it's impossible you just get bullet points there and then if you look up there are YouTube videos explaining you how to download code and to install this to make it look like a proper thing and It reminded me so much on obsidian where you can do anything you like in obsidian but you have to rely on third party developments and things like that and especially as a busy professional you cannot afford that this stops working on the next day so this was immediately obviously I I said no I'm I'm drafting this in HEPA base because when you need to compare it with something with something else then I would compare from the feeling of using the uuux heab base Is more like the notion in the PKM and tana is more like the obsidian so Tana is really a steeper learning curve and you have flexibility adding custom code and things like that to make it work the way you like it to but we always try to avoid the things and use the not native features only because then you can 100% rely on that it will work in the future as well over time the people the developers might add new features but as Pac already mentioned it's unlikely that Headbase will become a perfect outliner just based on this the infrastructure that they have in the back end and the same applies to Tana seeing visual canvases there it's questionable if it will be the same level as in heab base because I already mentioned you don't have long form text in Tana if you drag this into a map then then you have just bullet points in the map so and then Miro there you have the friction you cannot bring in your text easily and the The highlights that you did so heab base is really the speet spot but again mro we are using for brainstorming as a team it's so easy to really develop something from scratch being in a team so there that's really to sum this podcast up that's really the key takeaway here make yourself aware of the different information types that you have there think first of all information and action then in the information think about deep thinking versus shallow Thinking and then think about the different information types in these different areas before you even think about what tool you use just use a piece of paper and write it down there to get the the first overview of the things make yourself aware of all the information that you collect every day that you work with every day and write these down and then once you have this map try to apply the different tools that you're already using to these Different information types and you will already realize the friction points that that you face every day and then use this to your advantage to seek specifically for the right tools that cover these friction points or join the Payless movement membership Paco and I we are both personally in this membership and helping you to find the tools that you need for your workflows he will help you to lay out this iore framework where you put all the tools on There and you go through the iore Journey which includes the digital

大家好，欢迎收看 "专业生产力 "播客的新一期节目。今天我们要讨论一个非常激动人心的话题，我相信你们中的很多人都在为商业世界中的数字 "不采取 "而苦恼，今天我们将讨论很多关于这个问题的话题，我们将讨论浅层思考和深层思考之间的区别，以及你应该为你的 "不采取 "而使用的不同工具。我很高兴能在这里讨论这个深奥的话题，虽然我们会浅尝辄止，但这样大家就不会感到恼火，也不会感到困惑，因为我们是务实的，我们想要的是真正适合忙碌的专业人士的东西，就像我们一样，我已经准备好了。我不知道我们如何开始谈论这个问题，也许是开始采取的过程中，我不知道是的，我们可以，我们可以谈论的常见的事情，我们看到在社交媒体上的问题是什么是最好的不采取的应用程序哦，是啊，这是，然后通常人们回答单个字，如Evernote的概念等，但如果你去的网站Payless运动。我知道很多繁忙的专业人士也在使用苹果笔记来记录会议笔记，但我们也使用 clickup 来记录笔记，所以我们会在播客中揭示所有这些内容。因为我很喜欢看社交媒体上的互动，每当有人问什么是最好的不记笔记方式时，人们都会迅速回复，并展开讨论，还有人在谈论我不知道苹果笔记的概念，我不知道塔娜它是一个它是一个烂摊子，还有人把习惯跟踪器以及一切的一切，因为你把东西到一个系统的那一刻，你已经写或不采取你知道在这里一切都变得混乱，因为它是一个说一个我知道的东西，我想成为这就是为什么我们总是试图把事物拆分开来，这样通过拆分事物和概念，人们就能更好地理解事物。当谈到信息时，我们喜欢将其分为深层思考和浅层思考，因为这是不一样的，如果我在准备一篇博客文章，这和我在会议上记笔记是不一样的，或者我只是想记住一些东西。浅层思维指的是那种你用大脑思考的事情，你并不需要花很多时间去思考它，这就是Com set 好吧，在我们的课程里有更好的定义，好吧，但我只想呃，用通俗的语言让大家明白一点，只要你不去深入思考，就不是你需要专注的事情。你只是想把它写下来，因为你在开会，或者你在某个地方，你想把它写下来，这样你就可以随时回去检索这些信息，这就是肤浅的思考，这就是为什么我们可以开始在记笔记应用程序世界或不记笔记软件中创建一个分类，因为你会发现，基于这些大脑过程，你就可以开始理解为什么使用一种软件比使用所有软件更有意义，因为当你进入深度思考时，情况正好相反 深度思考是指当你需要真正理解一件复杂的事情时。 当你想交付一些需要集中精力的东西时，你需要考虑时间和大脑的运行过程，并将这两种大脑运行过程分开，我认为这将带来清晰度，好吧，开始不采取任何行动的旅程，并进入 PKM 世界，例如，我认为这里还需要提到的是，我们在 I core 中谈到的另一个概念是单一真相来源，因为这也意味着有不同的信息类型。因为这也意味着有不同的信息类型，现在你谈到了深层思维和浅层思维，但如果你看一下你试图收集或捕捉的信息，那么这些不同类型的信息会存储在不同的地方。因此，当我们说 "单一真相源 "时，就像人们说我在寻找最好的拍摄应用程序，而这将是收集所有信息的唯一应用程序一样，人们也会误以为 "单一真相源 "就是你试图建立的唯一真相源，它本质上就是你的端到端生产力系统。端将是你最终的单一真相源，但它被分割成不同的单一真相源，即使是在同一个工具中，你也可以用同样的方式来看待它。没有必要每个人都把这些信息写在自己的笔记本上，然后再坐在一起说，哦，你上次写了什么，然后再做会议记录。因此，这项任务就成了会议所讨论主题的唯一真理来源，我想从这里我们就能更好地理解该在哪里下笔。你的浅层思维内容可能有不同的工具，因为一个你只是在收集网站，另一个你只是在记录会议记录，所以这是两种不同类型的浅层思维。是的，你还可以信任技术，因为有不同的技术，比如我喜欢的一种技术叫 "提纲挈领"（outlining）。因为这取决于你的方式，因为你也在试图回答这个问题，什么是最好的不占用时间的方式，这取决于什么，取决于你的大脑是如何工作的，取决于你的情况，因为如果我在手机上，我可能会使用某个笔记应用程序，如果我在桌面上，我可以使用另一个，所以这没有任何意义。我认为，这才是人们应该回答的真正问题，或者说，这才是人们想要得到的答案，而答案并非来自这个问题。例如，如果你要去参加会议，而你有一台 iPad，我该如何获取信息？因为当你在 iPad 上与一个无法正常工作的应用程序交互时，你就得到了答案，然后你需要找到一些东西，如果你回到桌面，你想检索那些你毫不费力就能快速搜索到的会议记录，那么它就会给你提供另一种视角。因为我认为，我们的大多数成员和我们一样都是繁忙的专业人士，他们都在寻找清晰的答案，我们知道人们都在寻找工具，但他们关注的是 "如何"，但我们认为，这个关于 Comet 的小介绍，现在我们将看到我们定义的不同工作流程，以及我们如何在不同的工具中实现它们。我认为，我们面临的大多数不同情况都是听众每天都要面对的。当我有时在 YouTube 上看到有人评论说，你又在更换工具了，我现在也需要使用这个工具，或者我刚开始使用你三年前推荐的工具，现在你又突然更换了工具，这一点非常重要。我们在自己的系统中很少更换工具，但这并不意味着我们不审查新工具，而是总是从我们已经在使用的工具的角度来审查，但对我们来说，当我们认为某个工具更适合某个特定功能时，更换工具是非常容易的，因为这些与工具无关的工作流就是我们要转移到下一个工具的东西，所以工具就是我们要更换的。现在，我们可以讨论如何将信息迁移到下一个工具中等等，但这并不是真正的问题所在，另一个问题是，人们可能会认为我们在切换工具，但实际上，我们在谈论的是多个工具，而不是将信息迁移到下一个工具中。这就是为什么现在必须谈谈我们用的是什么工具，因为我们用的是几种工具，我们并没有在这些工具之间切换，它们都有特定的用途，现在人们显然想知道它们是什么工具，但重要的是，这些工具是我们帕科和我在无纸化运动中为特定业务使用的工具。这些工具是我们帕科和我在无纸化运动中为特定业务使用的工具，而不是我们所有成员使用的工具集。在这里，我们可以确认我们所教的内容是有效的，人们可以理解，这就是我所需要的，我不需要我们释放压力，我不需要使用我们推荐的工具或者 YouTube 上其他人推荐的工具，但是他们会选择最适合他们特定使用情况的工具。目前的设置是阅读器塔纳和HEPA基础，这是在io框架的PKM领域，然后我们也可以说bkm，即业务知识管理是我们也没有采取的clickup，但让我们坚持使用阅读器塔纳HEPA基础，因为这最好地解释了从浅层到深层思考的工作流程。我认为这也是我们需要区别对待的地方：这是从外部世界捕捉事物的过程，好吧，是你在某处发现的事物，你想要捕捉、还原和检索，还有你自己的想法，我认为这才是混乱的开始，好吧，因为人们会感到困惑，甚至我们自己也会感到困惑，因为不同的工具之间有很多重叠。因为不同的工具之间有很多重叠的地方，这是我们需要了解的，你知道软件公司倾向于像野兽一样提供功能，试图抓住尽可能多的人，尽可能多的客户，然后重叠的东西就出现了，然后人们就会感到困惑，因为有一些工作流程，你可以在不同的工具中实现，这就是我们需要了解的。我认为，在这个时候，最重要的是尽量减少应用程序的数量，并且要明白，无论软件公司说什么，每种工具都是针对特定的用例的，他们会尽量提供更多的功能，但通常情况下，我都会把这些功能放在一起。我的意思是，因为要完美地覆盖如此多的功能并不容易，有些工具针对某些功能，而有些工具则针对其他功能，它们都有弱点，这就是最重要的一点，要发现每个应用程序的优势，然后在你的工作流程（你在大脑中运行的流程）和每个工具的优势之间建立平行关系，这就是我们所做的。这就是我们所做的工作，好了，现在我们要分享的是如何启动浅层思维系统，比如我们使用的是塔娜，因为特别是在我的情况下，我的思维方式就像一个大纲制定者，这是我很久以前就学会的技巧。这就是为什么我们不会从一个月换到另一个月 我们说的是好几年 好吧 直到我们发现了更好的工具然后我们就能看到它的优缺点，很容易就能判断出当前的工具堆栈是比新工具更好还是更差，或者该工具在特定的使用场景或功能中是否真的很好用，因为例如有一些工具是专门为在移动设备上捕捉事物而设计的，你可以将其用于该使用场景。我认为，当人们面对软件世界时，他们会试图把自己变成一个或零或黑或白的人，我用这个或那个，而不是这样。如果你正在苦苦挣扎，如果你刚刚开始工作，那么我建议你尝试把所有东西都集中到一个工具中，你可能已经这样做了，但要意识到摩擦点在哪里，你需要在这个工具中记录什么类型的信息，就像你知道你有一个工具，当你有一个深入的思考过程时，你会感觉非常好。当你遇到一个复杂的问题时，你会有一个深入的思考过程，你会尝试管理这个问题，并找出问题的症结所在，这非常有效，但随后你会意识到，但会议记录的人，我真的很挣扎，我有很多摩擦，打开工具，记录笔记，然后尝试与团队分享，以及类似的事情，所以这就是你意识到的摩擦点。所以，这就是你意识到摩擦的地方，所以你有一个特定的用例 在这个工具内，你现在可以看看外面是否有其他专门的工具，例如会议记录工具，它可以让你轻松检索，轻松共享，甚至可以使用你业务中的现有系统来实现这一点，所以这就是它，然后是按键式方法，我会说我不知道。如果你也可以在这种情况下这么说的话，但是，是的，所以从一个工具开始，而不是试图找出好吧，我使用这套工具，然后它使一切都有意义，然后你会再次失败，因为你会被所有这些功能所淹没，这只是你慢慢调整你的系统的增量步骤，所以从一个工具开始，看看你在哪里遇到了你无法获得的墙，给你的摩擦，然后寻找下一个工具。我认为 "挤压工具 "是最美妙的事情之一，因为你可以从不同的使用案例、不同的场景、不同的情况入手，加倍努力，你迟早会发现摩擦，不管软件公司告诉你的是什么。不管软件公司告诉你什么，你都会发现那是行不通的，也许这只是因为我们必须明白，我们都是独立的个体，我们每个人的思维方式都是不同的，也许软件公司认为人们会遵循的工作流程与你所遵循的完全不同。就像我刚才说的，Tana 是最有效的工具，因为对我来说，我认为任何东西都是好的，因为我说的是存储和捕捉我自己的想法。因为我是在说存储和捕捉我自己的想法 这很重要 因为从外部世界来谈内容 对我和我们来说都很重要 在无纸化运动里 是readwise公司的reader但对我来说，"阅读器 "非常棒 因为它直接与 "阅慧 "连接 "阅慧 "可以帮你把 "阅读器 "上的内容突出显示出来例如，我每天都在回顾我所做的所有亮点，所以你可以工作流程是非常直接的没关系，因为它是很容易捕捉阅读器上的东西，无论你是在桌面上或移动没关系，你可以捕捉一个鸣叫，你可以捕捉一篇文章，你可以捕捉任何你可能会想象任何亮点我强烈建议你阅读他们很久以前开发阅读器时发表的宣言，因为它解释了所有用户在阅读器上遇到的所有摩擦。当我们在互联网上浏览或使用移动设备浏览信息时，我们会感到很痛苦，这很神奇，因为当你捕捉到一些东西时，你就可以开始消费这些内容了，在那一刻，每当你看到与你有共鸣的东西时，你就会高亮显示，然后就会自动发送，不仅是为了阅读，好吗之后，你还可以练习我刚才描述的空间重复过程，还可以使用很多 PKM 工具，比如 Hease，比如 Tana，比如 obsidian，比如一大堆工具。所以，在你的 PKM 工具中，我们马上要讨论的工具，以及你用来将信息转化为知识的工具，你正在接受行动，或者你是什么意思？如果你决定向前迈进，我们稍后会解释我们使用的工作流程，但重点是，只要阅读过，并为我自己的会议想法做准备，例如，当我去参加会议时，对我来说是非常直接的，因为子弹和提纲对我来说是很好的，好吗，它有助于我快速思考的过程，好吗，是的，给一点结构。就是这样，这就是一切的开端，你在系统中获得了信息，现在是在捕捉信息后进行处理的时刻了，是的，所以我们在不同的工具之间谈得有点无序，现在让我们来谈谈一个具体的工作流程吧。因此，我们在 PKM 专业课程和数字非专业课程以及实施部分中也详细介绍了这些工作流程，但总的来说，你会将这篇博文保存在阅读器中，在阅读器中你可以静下心来阅读这篇博文，而不会受到任何广告或类似内容的干扰。在阅读器中，你可以静下心来阅读这篇博文，而不会受到任何广告或类似内容的干扰，因此你可以将这些精华内容同步到 heab base 中。Tana 位于两者之间，你已经提到过 Tana 是用来记笔记的，比如会议记录，但也可以用来起草脚本。我想真正做到的一点是，我试着拥有这一个工具，我看到了摩擦，我总是回到塔纳，但我仍然试着在这种情况下最大限度地利用海布基地，但我不想扰乱基于 HEPA 的深度思考系统。因此，塔纳比HEPA更有意义，因为在塔纳，你有一个不同的设置来收集信息，如果你只是收集随机的想法等，那也无伤大雅，所以你是如何区分塔纳和HEPA的？这是我认为的一个用例，至于何时收集 Inna 中的内容，然后将其转移到 epab base 中，你的流程是什么，Paco 对我来说，嗯，重要的是，阅读器允许人们使用两个功能或两个流程，我认为这两个功能或流程非常有趣。这一点非常重要，因为你可以利用阅读的势头，在脑海中浮现出一些东西，然后你可以高亮显示，创建评论，然后继续工作。因为标签允许我们将内容发送到所谓的 "桶 "中，"桶 "就像一个 "收件人"，"桶 "中的所有内容或多或少都是相互关联的，这样你就可以去那里创建一个想象，比如我可以创建一个名为 PKM 或 "不接受 "之类的标签，当你对此感兴趣时，你就可以使用纯文本创建一个搜索。因为标记是一种非常好的技术，可以在不同的工具之间连接信息，因为你在不同的工具中使用相同的标记和相同的数据桶。汤姆刚才问我的问题是 "清晰"（Crystal Clear），当我需要把一些东西转移到深度思考系统（在我们的例子中是 epas）时，我就会开始勾画，当我试图发展一种思考方式时，我就会看到并感觉到它变得非常杂乱，好吧，我开始迷失方向了，我无法继续上下移动东西，我很困惑，这时候我就会转移到 epas。因为EPAS有一个非常神奇的功能，就是将文本与可视化白板结合起来，这一点非常重要，因为在我们的生活中，在我们的思考过程中，有那么一刻我们需要可视化。 如果它是一张卡片，那么在该卡片的数据库中输入 "Tana 大纲"，然后复制并粘贴到 Tana 的链接，这样我就可以手动创建 epab 和 Tana 之间的连接，不需要自动化，也不需要过于复杂。这样做的好处是，我可以向前移动，然后使用白板，在那一刻，我可以开始看到不同的编译集，我用它来写下东西，然后我在白色世界中创建不同的元素、不同的对象，并开始为这些元素和对象排序。我们在讨论 eptas 的时候发现，与其他视觉思维工具（比如镜像）相比，最重要的一点是，Epis 能很好地创建文本，而文本内容是以文本为基础的。我知道听播客的人可能会感到困惑，但如果他们看了我们分享的关于数据库的视频，就会发现这真的非常简单，这也是为什么我们今年转用 epab base 的原因之一。因为这些人是如何把文字和视觉元素结合在一起的，而你又不需要是书呆子，这太神奇了，非常简单，非常直接，非常直观。顺便说一下，虽然 Eptas 不是一个纯粹的大纲工具，但你可以使用子弹来工作，你可以折叠，你可以创建这个控件的名字是什么我不记得了，你可以上下移动，所以你可以放大和缩小段落中的信息，因为你可以创建章节，然后折叠。因为你可以创建章节，然后你可以折叠折叠这些章节，你可以打开切换标题，是的，切换，是切换，这非常重要，因为这样你就可以不断发展你的思维，因为我在 Tana 上做的一些事情就是创建一个指向 epas 白板的链接，这样我就可以比如说然后你就会看到我们是如何在不费吹灰之力的情况下，利用每个应用程序的最佳功能进行工作的，这是最重要的。你是最好的 PKM 工具，来自 atab 的人也会这么说，无论你在哪里，无论你看什么，他们都会看到，因为也许很多人可以只使用 atab 或 T，他们可以开发你的思维，但对我来说，没有大纲是一个见证，也没有视觉思维在一定程度上也是一个胜利，所以，这是不可能的，因为再深入一点，这就是为什么它是，因为你开发的方式和他们创建应用程序的方式是完全不同的，这就是为什么它不能成为它是不可能的。这就是为什么它不能成为它是不可能的，也许他们可以做发明或什么的人从黑曜石好吧黑曜石使用插件，他们正在创建的视觉思维好吧，他们也有插件来创建一个大纲，但当你比较黑曜石与一个插件的大纲经验与任何纯粹的大纲器工作在比较视觉工具时，因为即使是那些在视觉方面非常出色的工具，比如 mirror，当你比较 epas 的视觉功能和 miror 的视觉功能时，miror 毫无疑问会胜出。他们从一些重要的工具中提炼出了一些特性，例如 mirror Rome 或 notion，并创造出了一些对某些工作流程来说非常好用的东西。但我也意识到，在T里工作的时候，需要处理长篇文字，所以每当你想写一篇博文的时候，比如在Tana里，就不可能了，你只会得到弹出式要点，然后如果你翻看YouTube上的视频，就会知道如何下载代码和安装这些东西，让它看起来像一个合适的东西，这让我想起了《黑曜石》，你可以在《黑曜石》里做任何你想做的事情，但你必须依赖第三方开发和类似的东西。特别是作为一个繁忙的专业人士，你无法承受第二天就停止工作的情况，所以很明显，我马上就说不，我要用 HEPA base 来起草这个，因为当你需要将它与其他东西进行比较时，我会从使用 Uuux 的感觉上进行比较，Heab base 更像是 PKM 中的概念，而 Tana 更像是黑曜石，所以 Tana 确实是一个更陡峭的学习曲线，而且你可以灵活地添加插件。但我们总是尽量避免使用非原生功能，因为这样你就可以百分之百地相信它在未来也能正常工作。就像 Pac 已经提到的那样，Headbase 不可能成为一个完美的大纲器，这只是基于他们在后端所拥有的基础架构。因为我已经说过，在 Tana 中你没有长篇文字，如果你把它拖到地图中，那么你在地图中就只有弹出点，所以 Miro 中就有摩擦，你不能轻易地把你的文字和你做的亮点带进来，所以 heab base 确实是个好地方，但 Mro 又是我们团队用来进行头脑风暴的地方，它很容易真正从头开始开发一些东西。在一个团队中，从零开始开发一些东西非常容易，所以这就是这次播客的总结，也是这次播客的关键收获。在考虑使用什么工具之前，先用一张纸写下来，对事情有一个初步的了解，让自己意识到每天收集到的所有信息，并把这些信息写下来，然后一旦你有了这张地图，就尝试把你已经在使用的不同工具应用到这些不同的信息类型中，你就会意识到你每天面临的摩擦点，然后利用这一点来为自己谋利。帕科和我都是Payless movement的会员，我们会帮助你找到工作流程所需的工具，他将帮助你制定iore框架，把所有工具都放在上面，然后你就可以开始iore之旅了，其中包括 "像专业人士一样不使用数字工具 "和 "像专业人士一样使用PKM "课程，真正完全覆盖p amm领域。如果你还没有加入，我们每周都会在播客中与你见面，请务必订阅，下次再见。
