I'm very pleased to be here and thank you for that introduction tonight this evening I'd like to call your attention to attention and let me begin with a story it's about a classic experiment in social psychology it was done many years ago at the Princeton Theological Seminary with divinity students each student was told that they're going to give a practice sermon they'd receive a topic to prepare and then they go to Another building and give the sermon to be evaluated half of the students were given the parable of the Good Samaritan as their topic the man who stopped to help the stranger in need by the side of the road the other half were given random Bible topics as each divinity student went over to the other building to give their sermon they passed a man who was bent over and moaning in pain the interesting question is did they stop to help the more interesting Question is did it matter if they're pondering the parable of the Good Samaritan what do you think didn't matter make no difference at all what mattered was how much time pressure people felt they're under and this is more or less the story of our lives there's a spectrum that runs from noticing the other person to tuning into the other person to empathizing and understanding what's going on with them and then if they're in need and there's Something we can do compassion and maybe helping them but if we never notice in the first place we never go down that road and this is the problem with attention today it's under siege I think the moment I knew we're in trouble was a while back before I started writing the book focus I was on my way to a meeting I was driving I live out in the country in New England I was late but I was wanting people there to Know I was coming so as I was driving I was texting them on my way that's rather horrible because it turns out as I read not very long after that that texting while driving is the same as drinking while driving it's really bad in fact in my state it's outlawed now another thing I've noticed is when I was writing the book I'd be kind of on a riff really in flow writing well then I'd have to look something up so I go to Google Scholar I love Google Scholar because it gives you access to the academic database so I opened my web browser and my web browser presents me with the news of the day and I'm a news junkie so all of a sudden I start reading news stories and before I know it I've been lot you know fifteen twenty minutes has gone by before I realized that oh I was supposed to be looking that up and today we're all in the same boat and that the tools that we use our Computer our phone and so on are also devised to interrupt us to seduce us to draw our attention from this to that and usually under that is trying to sell us something a pop-up ad or whatever but attention is besieged in a way that has never been true before when I was going around to publishers and telling him I wanted to write about attention one publishers said to me that's wonderful we'd love to have that book but could you keep it short So what happened to us in in 2007 Time magazine a major American publication had a small article it said there's a new word in the English language the word is pizzle it's a combination of puzzled and pissed-off and it refers to the moment when you're with someone who takes out their blackberry and starts talking to someone else and ignoring you in 2007 that was unusual but the word pizzle has died with the blackberry because now that's the new social norm You go out to a dinner very romantic restaurant you see a couple together and they're both looking at their phones instead of into each other's eyes something has happened to us in 1977 Nobel Prize winner Herbert Simon wrote a very prescient he said information consumes attention hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention I think we've entered a time when we're in danger of intentional impoverishment and the the signs of it Are more than you know a couple watching they're looking at the phone instead of it into each other's eyes you the other day I saw a mom holding a little toddler and the toddler's trying to get her attention and she's busy texting he's just not available and you know of course dad's same story I was on a vacation island last summer Martha's Vineyard off the coast of New England and I was taking a taxi from the ferry to my house and I happened to share it With seven sorority sisters college students who were going for a weekend together and we got in the it was a shared taxi a big van and we got in the taxi and within a minute or two every one of the sorority sisters was staring into a screened iphone/ipad but they weren't talking to each other and I think this is a real long the ingredients of rapport are three the first is full mutual attention from that full attention comes a second ingredient It's a nonverbal synchrony if you look at two people who are really in rapport really connecting if you were to make a video of that and watch it in silence the two bodies look as though they're choreographed this is something that's managed by a category of brain cell called oscillators oscillators govern how we respond to someone else how we respond to physical objects oscillators are very important for the survival of the human species consider this at the Moment of a first kiss they determine the velocity at which two skulls come together and if they get it wrong it would be the end of the species I'm sure the third ingredient after the full attention and the nonverbal synchrony is that it feels good it's a rather pleasant joyous state to connect with someone that well these are the moments in our lives that are the richest that that really matter however recently there was an article in the Harvard Business Review called the human moment it said if you want to have real connection with someone and if they come into your office or remember this turn away from your screen ignore your phone and on every other device stop your daydream or whatever's on your mind and pay full attention to the person in front of you I find it said that we have to have an article in a Harvard Business Review to tell us something like that but it has come to this because Attention is a rarer and rarer commodity but it's a very precious commodity I think the time has come for us to take an active stand in our lives and fight back against this subtle onslaught I know a couple for example who when they come home have a pact that they'll put their phones in a drawer they won't look at them for the evening there's a new way of getting together I don't know if this has happened here in the UK but in the States for example When people get together for dinner everybody takes their phone out puts it in the middle of the table and the first person that reaches for their phone before the bill comes has to pay the bill now there's not just one kind of tension attention there's several varieties the most obvious is selective attention when we focus on one thing and ignore others there are two main kinds of distractors two general classes one is sensory distractors so if you're Looking at me you're probably not noticing this whiteboard here right that's relatively easy the tough one is the second category it's emotional distractors our emotional distractors are extremely powerful they're thoughts about that conversation that didn't go so well the Tiff's I had with my partner this morning the mostly relationship concerns things that have upset us so the more focused we are the better we do at anything as a rather obvious but for Example a test of concentration among athletes predicts how well they'll do the next season that's rather straightforward and the less our mind wanders or students mind modern rule reading a text the better we comprehend the text however it turns out on average while we're reading a book our mind wanders about twenty to forty percent of the time I think it depends on the book that particular study was done with Pride and Prejudice If it had been done say with I don't know fifty shades of gray or blink or whatever it might have been different but the the point is that the more disrupted attention is particularly for young people the harder it is for them to grasp to build the cumulative mental models that amount to mastery and in any subject there are basically three modes of attention I want to call your attention to and here's a schematic so this is generally the relationship Between performance say this is high this is low and this is the the horizontal line is brain activity particularly levels of stress hormones like cortisol adrenaline and the relationship is very telling it goes like this it's an upside-down U and the highest performance is when attention is absolutely a hundred percent maybe a hundred and ten percent it's been called flow flow is discovered For those of you who don't know about it by researchers who asked people in in many different domains of expertise basketball players ballerinas neurosurgeons tell us about a time you outdid yourself you were absolutely at your best even you were surprised and no matter what the domain was people were describing the same phenomena djegal state and one of the characteristics of the state is that attention is utterly absorbed there Was a neurosurgeon who said I had to do a surgery an operation that I didn't really know if I could it was so difficult but I did it superbly I was really surprised myself at the end of the surgery I looked around and I saw some rubble in the corner of the operating theatre I said what happened they said while you were operating the roof you didn't over there and you didn't notice it's that kind of attention it's Unbreakable it's also a state where your skills are called upon at the utmost and whatever the demand is you can meet it you're very flexible very adaptable and very tellingly it's a state that feels good it's it's like rapport rapport is mutual flow interpersonal flow so that's when focus is a hundred percent when you have too much to do too little time too little support when you feel overwhelmed you're down here and the stress hormones at their highest you're In a state which was called recently in the scientific journal action of the journal Science in an article was called the neurobiology of frazzle I don't know if you're familiar with frazzle I've been there many times it's constant stress and here the problem is you can't stop thinking about what's upsetting you what's stressing you you're not focusing here you're not focusing on the task at hand you're focusing on what's upsetting you And that's the power of emotions emotions take over attention they guide attention and if they're too strong then you'll never get up here over here performance is low because people are under motivated disengage this is a huge problem of disengagement in the workplace people feel in fact there was a survey this is really interesting was done at Harvard 2,500 people are given an iPhone app and the app rings them at random times during the day and they Answer two questions what are you doing now and what are you thinking about now and the discrepancy of course is a lot as a measure of mind wandering turns out 50 percent of the time on average our minds are wandering the one activity that had the highest focus no surprise was making love but who fills out that at a time like that I still haven't been able to figure that out the the lowest three were commuting sitting at a computer and work that's this so if You're not engaged in what you're doing your cortisol levels are too low so I've been talking about focusing as though it were the only valuable kind of attention but actually mind wandering which is the enemy of focusing the term they use in brain sciences they are anti-correlated if your mind is wandering by definition you're not focusing and vice versa mind wandering is absolutely essential for creative insight the creative process demands that first of all you gather Information you focus on the problem you really concentrate and then you let go the annals of science art and mathematics are full of people who came up with incredible solutions when they're just daydreaming in the shower getting on a bus walking your dog and that's because during mind-wandering we're able to make connections between remote elements in a new way that has value that's the definition of a creative act of course if you're going To execute if you're going to put the idea to use then you have to go back into focus but mind-wandering is extremely extremely valuable there's another level that which attention operates this has to do with leadership but I argue that leaders need three kinds of focus to be really effective the first is an inner focus let me tell you about a case that's actually from the annals of Neurology there was a corporate lawyer who unfortunately had a Small prefrontal brain tumor it was discovered early operated successfully after the surgery though he it was very puzzling picture because he was absolutely as smart as he had been before a very high IQ no problem with the tension or memory but he couldn't do his job anymore he couldn't do any job he in fact he ended up out of work his wife left him he lost his home he's living in his brother's spare bedroom and in despair he went to see a famous Neurologist named Antonio Damasio Damacio specializes in the circuitry between the prefrontal area which is where we consciously pay attention to what matters now where we make decisions where we learn and the emotional centers in the midbrain particularly the amygdala which is our radar for radar for danger it triggers our strong emotions they had cut the connection between the prefrontal area and emotional centers and demacia at first Was puzzled he he realized that this fellow on every neurological test was perfectly fine but he something was wrong and then he got a clue he asked the lawyer when should we have our next appointment and he realized the lawyer could give him the rationale pros and cons of every hour for the next two weeks but he didn't know which is best and Damacio says when we're making a decision any decision when to have the next appointment should I leave my job For another one what strategy should we follow going into the future who should I marry this fellow compared to all the other fellows I mean those are decisions that require we draw on our entire life experience and the circuitry that collects that life experience is very base brain it's very ancient in the brain and it has no direct connection to the part of the brain that thinks in words it has very rich connectivity to the Castro intestinal tract to the gut So we get a gut feeling feels right doesn't feel right Damacio calls them somatic markers it's a language of the body and the ability to tune into this is extremely important because this is valuable data - they did a study of California entrepreneurs and asked them how do you make your decisions these are people who built a business from nothing to hundreds of millions or billions of dollars and they more or less said the Same strategy I'm a voracious gatherer of information I want to see the numbers but if it doesn't feel right I won't go ahead with the deal they're tuning into the gut feelings I know someone I grew up in a farm region of California the Central Valley and my high school had a rival High School in the next town and I met him someone who went to that other high school he almost he was not a good student he almost failed it didn't graduate came close to not graduating High school he went to a two-year college at community college that we call them found his way into film which he loved and got into a film school in film school his student project caught the eye of a director who asked him to become an assistant and he did so well at that that the director arranged for him to direct his own film someone else's script he did so well at that they let him direct a script that he had written and that film did surprisingly Well so the studio that financed that film said if you want to do another one we will back you and he however hated the way the studio edited the film he felt he was a creative artist and they had butchered his art he said I'm gonna do the film on my own I'm gonna finance it myself this was everyone in the film business that he knew said this is a huge mistake you shouldn't do this but he went ahead then he ran out of money Had to go to 11 banks before he could get a loan he finished managed to finish the film you may have seen the film it's called Star Wars so George Lucas made a decision on the basis of his gut it didn't feel right to let the studio mangle his next gnome he read was his integrity and this inner sense is ethical it's an ethical writer you know it answers the question is what I'm about to do in keeping with my sense of meaning values And ethics that's not a question that we answer first in words we answer first and what feels right and doesn't feel right then we put it into words and every leader today needs a strong ethical rudder so I'd say an inner awareness inner focus is essential then there's other focus which is being able to read people being able to tune into the person there are three kinds of empathy and this is empathy I'm talking about the first is cognitive cognitive Empathy means I understand how you think about things your mental models how you see the world what that means is I'm able to communicate with you in terms you really understand you really resonate with managers leaders who are able to talk to other people with good cognitive empathy are able to get better than expected performance out of people because they know how to mobilize them they know what matters then there's emotional empathy Emotional empathy is an immediate felt sense of what's going on in the other person and this is absolutely essential to if you only have cognitive empathy and you don't have emotional empathy you'll be you'll miss the mark the Third Kind of empathy is very important too it's empathic concern not only do I know how you think and how you feel but if there's something I something you need and I can help you with I'm predisposed to help the leaders who have the most Loyalty who people love working for have all three kinds of empathy there's an article in the Harvard Business Review called leadership run amok leadership run amok is about people who may have cognitive empathy but lack the other two these are leaders who are very good at hitting the target for example but don't care about what happens to the people that they manage they have no feeling for them and so they demoralize people our people are ready to leave if Abell the third kind of focus is outer focus this is very important for example in formulating strategy you need to understand the ecosystem within which your organization operates you need to be able to sense what's going to work what we'll need to do in the future and so on and for that you need a kind of systems view big-picture thinking the sad story here is actually the blackberry there are two kinds of basically two kinds of strategic Thinking one is exploitation the other is exploration in exploitation you take a product or a brand that's worked very very well and you fine-tune it you tweak it you keep making it better because it keeps working for you that's what blackberry did the danger is if you don't also explore exploration means you see you look widely you see what's happening where things are going you do R&D you try to come up with the next new thing and they failed they failed to see For example Samsung they failed to see what the competition was doing if you so if you don't have an inner focus and an other focus and an outer focus the danger is being rudderless clueless or blindsided attention is a mental muscle it's it's like going to the gym if you go to the gym and you lift weights every time you do a repetition you strengthen the muscle that you're working a tension can be strengthened in the same way in fact I think I'll show you how if you're Interested it just take two minutes all you have to do is sit straight up close your eyes and bring your attention to your breath don't try to control your breath just watch your breath to observe it try to sense it coming in and out maybe your nostrils and watch every breath the full in-breath the full out-breath start over again with the next breath and just start again with the next breath be fully aware of the sensation and if you find that your mind Is somewhere else bring it back again and gently restart now you can open your eyes but did anybody notice their mind wandering did anybody bring it back that's the rep actually the exercise is not keeping your mind focus the exercise is when it wanders bringing it back that's what strengthens the connectivity in the attentional circuitry this is a study that was done at Emory University and this is a basic muscle to mind What's interesting to me is that we don't exercise it typically we depend on externals to grab our attention in fact our economy in a sense is built on the grabbing of attention habituation is what the brain does when it's this sees the same old thing day after day after day save walking the same way to work or whatever it is you don't see it after a while the brain economizes on attention orienting on the other hand is opening Up it's whenever the brain encounter is something new novel and surprising it excites the brain and think about it every season there's a new fashion well what is a new fashion it's actually a minor variation on a basic product every year there's a new car well what's a new car it's just enough difference to excite the orienting response so it's the basis of our economy it's a very radical move to cultivate the ability to manage your own mind so that you can Orient at will but that's exactly what's possible with the tension training and I become a big advocate of it one of the reason is the research Richard Davidson who's a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin has expertise in the brain and emotion and he's found in his research that when were agitated when we're upset and angry and anxious there's a lot of activity in the right prefrontal area just behind the floor also in the amygdala of the brains Trigger point for the fight flight freeze response when we're on the other hand in a really positive state I feel great enthusiastic what a wonderful day there's a lot of activity on the left side and no activity on the right each of us has a renter ratio at rest of right-to-left activity that predicts our mood range day to day he finds there's a bell curve for this like for IQ most of us are in the middle we have bad days we have good days if you're very far to the Right you may be clinically depressed a clinically anxious if you're very far to the left you're very resilient you bounce right back from setbacks so Davidson paired up with a fella named Jon kabat-zinn who has made mindfulness as he calls it very popular for example in the in the medical sector as a way to manage chronic conditions and also in the states of leasing business recently a lot of businesses are bringing it in and it's more or less what we just did Davidson and kabat-zinn went to a biotech startup 24/7 you know high pressure environment and they taught people how to do mindfulness which is more or less the exercise of watching the breath but they did it 30 minutes a day for eight weeks what he found was that before that people's brains were tilted to the right they're pretty hassled and stressed after eight weeks 30 minutes a day they were tilting back toward the left and what's very Interesting is people spontaneously started saying hey you know I'm starting to enjoy my work again I remember what I loved about this job in other words the positive mood was really making a difference there's one reason that businesses are bringing it in I myself feel that it's not we adults who our most in need of paying attention to attention in this way I think it's children because childhood has changed Childhood has changed as a side effect of this onslaught of the digital world into our personal universe I was talking to an 8th grade teacher who was complaining about how kids now are texting in the States I didn't know about here texting has overcome phone calls among teenagers as a preferred way to connect their kids who will send a hundred texts a day to their friends and that's that's not unusual she said you know for 20 years I've been Teaching the same book to my 13 year olds it's Edith Hamilton's mythology and she said in the last two three four years my students are starting to say they're having trouble reading this it's a little too hard and she attributes it to a loss of ability to comprehend because of this constant distraction I saw a kid maybe nine or ten years old riding a bicycle and texting while he was riding can you believe that luckily it was in the country on a country lane The reason I'm worried about children is that the brain is the last organ of the body to become anatomically mature it starts growing from birth and it actually doesn't finish until the mid 20s during that time the principle of neuroplasticity is extremely important neuroplasticity says that repeated experiences shape the brain use it or lose it as another way of saying it if a child has an experience for example of empathy and another experience of Empathy the circuitry for empathy grows if a child has experience of paying full attention and ignoring distractors which is what we just did the connectivity for that circuitry grows and children need this in order for their brains to develop well when we see a child grow and go through different phases of childhood what we're seeing are the external signs of brain growth and I think it's it's incumbent on us to help children shape their brains in the best Way I was in classroom of seven year olds in Spanish Harlem in Manhattan Spanish Harlem is a very impoverished place the children they're living in housing projects and the projects are pretty dire one child came to class the teacher told me and was a little shaken he just seen somebody shot and the teacher said how many how many of you have know someone who's been shot every hand went up it's that kind of childhood it's a very tough place and I happen to Be there to watch something called breathing buddies every day this classroom all the kids have a session where they go to their little cubbies and they get a favorite stuffed animal and they lie it down on a rug on the floor they put the animal on their belly and they watch it go up with the in breath and down when they breathe out and they count one two three on them one two three on the out-breath and they're doing exactly what we just Did exactly what they're strengthening the capacity the mental muscle of attention there's something else there's a twofer here because the same circuitry also calms stormy emotions the ability to manage emotions is inextricably linked with the ability to pay attention and the teacher said you know one day because of a scheduling problem we had to skip this and the class was chaotic the class was chaotic so it makes a huge difference for these kids I've long been An advocate of what's called social emotional learning social emotional learning takes the emotional intelligence component self-awareness managing your inner life empathy handling relationships and makes it part of the curriculum not in a way that takes away from academics but in a way that enhances children's ability to handle themselves and their relationships and children's relationships if your paradise Need to tell you this but from puberty on before puberty the most important relationships in a child's life are family after puberty forget family it's other kids and the melodramas of childhood they didn't invite me to the party whatever it me capture attention those are emotional upsets the more you can manage those upsets the more attentional capacity you have to hear what the teacher is saying one of the things they do in these classes in these Programs I've seen this in New Haven in a neighborhood very similar to Spanish Harlem there's a a poster on the wall of every classroom it's a stop like a traffic light red light yellow light green light it says when you're upset remember the stop light red light stop calm down and think before you act well stop says you have a choice calm down means you can manage your inner turmoil think before you act is a Very valuable lesson because it says you can't determine what emotions you're going to have our emotions come unbidden but once you have them you can stop and think what you're going to do in fact one definition of maturity is lengthening the gap between impulse and action yellow light think of a range of things you could do and what the consequences might be green light pick the best one and try it Out this is a lesson in what's called cognitive control some of you may know about the marshmallow test it's another legendary study in psychology four-year-olds at Stanford University or brought into a room one by one sat down as a small table big juicy marshmallow put in front of them the experimenter says to this for you you can have the marshmallow now if you want but if you don't eat it till I come back from running an errand you can have to then Then she leaves the room this is a predicament that tries the soul of any four-year-old I assure you I've seen video on it some of them will go up and sniff it is over dangerous and then jump back and others go off and sing and dance themselves in a corner to stay distracted about a third of the kids can't stand it they just grab it and gobble it down on the spot and another third or so wait the endless 1012 minutes until the Experimenter comes back and they get the two marshmallows the payoff from the study came 14 years later when they're tracked down as they're about to go to university and the two groups are compared the ones who gobbled the ones who waited and it turns out the ones who waited get along much better with their peers they're still able to delay gratification and pursuit of their goals which is exactly what that's a test of and this was a surprise on the american University entrance exam the SAT which at that time had 1600 total points the kids who waited had a 210 point advantage over the kids who grabbed this is really interesting because these are all children of parents at stanford university these are high IQ high achieving families so what's going on but the difference seems to be that if you're not able to manage your impulse and mind-wandering is kind of a microcosm of that then you're going to Be more upset you're going to be more emotional you're not going to be able to pay attention to what the teacher is saying so you can't learn as well there was a study done just a few years ago in New Zealand every child in a city in New Zealand became part who was born over course of a year became part of the study from ages four to eight they were rigorously tested on cognitive control many different measures including the marshmallow type test and then when They're in their 30s they tracked down again and it turned out the cognitive control the ability keep your mind here or bring it back when it wanders was a better predictor of financial success and health in the mid-30s than either IQ or the social economic status of the family and it's a completely independent factor in fact the people who did the study argue that we should be teaching this ability to children in order to level The playing field so this is becoming part of social-emotional learning social emotional learning though also means being smart about your relationships so here's something that happened in New Haven among eleven-year-old boys they're going to play what we call soccer I think you erroneously call it football here is that right so the these kids were three boys going to play slightly the first kid is kind of pudgy not very athletic and the two kids behind them Very good at soccer very athletic and they're making sarcastic remarks to this first kid and one of the other kids says to this first kid the big sneer oh so you think you're going to play soccer and the pudgy kid stops takes a deep breath as though to brace himself for the confrontation I had this could easily lead to a fight in the school turns around and says yeah I'm gonna try to play soccer I'm not very good at it what I'm good at his art show me Anything I can draw her really well but you you're fantastic at soccer someday I'd like to be as good as you are and at that the other kid just melts comes up puts his arm around and says oh you're not so bad let me show you a thing or two that was no accident that is called a put-up that Boyd learned it in his sel it's a way to handle put-downs which is a very big problem in the teenage early teen years and it's just part of a wider curriculum which pays attention to what Matters to kids and attention needs to be part of that curriculum and it's not just schools you know parents of the first coach and all of this when you pick up a baby who's crying and soothe her you're actually teaching her how to soothe herself when you point out to a toddler you know when you did that it made your friend feel bad that's a lesson in empathy so it's you know these the lessons in attention and emotional Intelligence start very very early in life but I think we've got to get better at it one reason is the kids are being exposed more and more to influences that aren't so great I don't know if you know anyone any youngster who likes video games and spends hours that then maybe it doesn't happen here in London but it's a big problem worldwide and the data on video games is rather mixed for one thing they actually do enhance some aspects of attention if you're a kid who Likes to play fighting games you know battle games and you have to be constantly on the lookout for the enemy who might pop up and kill you it's very good for enhancing vigilance you could be a very good air traffic controller for example however it also means that if a kid happens to bump you in the hallway your first thought is that he has a grudge against you you get a bias toward hostile attribution so the video games that we have now are rather mixed But there's a new generation coming along which is using findings from cognitive science there's one called tenacity that I had my four grandchildren play ages 7 to 13 at the time in tenacity you have an iPad every time you breathe out you tap the screen on the fifth out-breath you tap it twice if you do that you get a visual reward you know flowers blooming in the desert as you do it more and more it gets harder and harder so basically what it's Doing is training attention but in a way that keeps the attention of kids the same way that all the other video games do there are there are other things that we could be using you know the media generally and I say this is a reformed journalist the media gives us a very toxic view of the world most of the news we get is about disaster death threats horrible things happening to people it's news for the amygdala the amend oh is a very primitive part of the Brain that wants to know what are the dangers however if we were to take on any given day all of the acts of kindness performed around the globe you know a mom feeding her kid is an act of kindness and we would put it on one scale and then were to take all the atrocious acts and put them on the loser scale the acts of kindness would far outweigh those of meanness but we don't get that sense of the world looking through a media lens But you we can use the media better one example I like is Sesame Street if you have ever if you have a toddler I've had a toddler you may have watched Sesame Street Sesame Street I found when I visited Sesame Workshop is actually a very sophisticated operation the day I went there the script writers were meeting with two cognitive scientists they're actually meeting about cognitive control because Sesame Street segments turn out to be lessons based in science Wrapped in entertainment one of the things that segments that aired this season is the cookie connoisseur Club I know if you're familiar with Cookie Monster Cookie Monster is one of the stars of Sesame Street and he loves to gobble cookies but Alan who runs a store on Sesame Street decided to start a cookie connoisseur Club very much like a wine connoisseur club and the cookie connoisseur Club you take a cookie and you study it to see if they're Imperfections then you sniff it for aroma and then you take a nibble to taste it Cookie Monster of course was dying to get into the club so Alan gives him a cookie and he instantly gobbles it down he can't restrain himself so Alan tells him you know in this club we're going to try all kinds of cookies so if you don't gobble it down I can you into the club and you're going to be able to eat many many different kinds of Cookie that does it for cookie so that's a lesson this is a show that is loved by two to four year olds and two to four year olds learn largely by modeling so what's happening with cookie is that people that the kids are learning a lesson in cognitive control and I think the more of that the better so let me finish with by telling you about a smart use of positive emotion of being able to manage our own internal world of that inner focus there is a remarkable man Named matthieu ricard he's written some books on happiness he's his friend she has a doctorate in cell biology from Pasteur Institute his mentor there actually won a Nobel Prize for the research they're doing but after graduate school he made a startling decision he decided he'd give up science and go to the Himalayas become a monk and meditate for the rest of his life he's been called I think by his publishers publicists the happiest man In the world because he's been studied by scientists and on this right-to-left ratio he's very far to the left there's a scientist named Paul Ekman who's the world's expert on the facial expression of emotion Paul is the keenest observer of the face as a revealer of what you're feeling is a very dangerous man I once was walking down the street with Paul on the way to a meeting that I was conducting and Paul was telling me about a system for training people to get good At this that he had just developed and as he's telling it we're getting to the meeting hall and I thought this is really interesting but I hope he wraps it up I've got to think about what I'm gonna do in the meeting at that moment he says to me and if someone had studied the system they'd know you're getting a little angry with me right now this is why pathes so dangerous Paul was interested in emotional contagion he wanted to know what would The effect be someone like Mathieu who was very very upbeat on someone who was quite the opposite so Paul did a quiet phone survey of faculty at the University of where he teaches asking who is the most abrasive difficult confrontational member of our faculty oddly enough everyone agreed who that was so he calls Professor X aces in the interests of science would you take part in a Scientific experiment and the professor's delighted said sure I'd be happy to as the day drew near and error he started making demands which became increasingly outrageous and so they had to dump him and go with the second most difficult professor and the experiment was they're both they're having the Mathieu and the professor have their physiology measured and they're going to have a debate the debate is on the premise that the professor should do With Mathieu did the professor had a very influential secure well-paid tenured(任期) position but the premise of the debate was that he would give it up and become a monk and go to Hermitage for the rest of his life at the beginning of this debate that physiology showed he was really agitated at the thought of that Mathieu was totally calm so as the discussion starts Mathieu stays absolutely calm and the professor gets calmer and calmer and calmer by the End of 15 minutes he's having such a good time he doesn't want to stop the discussion so our emotions are contagious for better or for worse particularly when we pay full attention to each other I once was waiting for a bus on a very hot humid day in New York City in August it's the kind of day I don't know about London but in New York we have a rather invisible balloon around us we're feeling a little prickly it says don't talk to me don't touch me And my balloon intact and the bus pulls up get on with my balloon and the bus driver did something quite surprising he actually spoke to me he said how is they Bend I was shocked but I sat down taking most of my bubble with me then I realized this bus drivers carrying on a conversation with everyone on the bus you're looking for suits I you know there's a great sale over here on the right in this department store and did you hear about the Monnet exhibit on the Left that the means wonderful and the Cineplex on were coming to here I know the movie and cinema for got the best reviews but the one in cinema 2 shot the other night fantastic you should on and on like that and then people would get off the bus and he'd say to them I hope the rest of your day is really wonderful that man was an urban Saint he transformed everyone on the bus he was sending ripples of good feeling through a city that sorely needed it and I think The bottom line is you know you don't have to go to the Himalayas for decades we all can do that in our lives if we pay attention thank you very much so I'm happy to I'm happy to answer any questions you might have their mics here and there's standing might some tools in the galleries so just raise your hand if you have a question first question over here you mentioned the low cultures in America where there are murders every Day Steven Pinker writes very well about some of these cultures and explains that people will be killed over a simple slight a disrespect or something and it's ingrained in the culture it's innate the thing that I can see there's a there seems to be an insidious political correctness in the world today where we're not allowed to say that a culture is a rubbish culture and in doing that we don't address the problems with these people so every day they Continue to have the low expectations the murders the the social Melia that creates and continues to create what you in America called the broken window syndrome and I wondered what your view was on the inability for people to address these problems honestly and openly and even going on to the fact that a lot of our condition is genetically inherited the brain is no different to any other organ in the body that whole groups of people get a Particular kind of genetics sure well I think there's a very young after that it's it's not being addressed at all and we're losing out over that yes well I know of some data which speaks directly to that I think first of all we have to be very careful about stereotypes because in any given neighborhood there's a range of variation who happens to live there there may happen to be some very talented young people who live in a neighborhood which is otherwise Rife with problems so for one thing we should allow for individual differences but generally it's a worldwide problem what to do with children who grow up in dire poverty because from one thing the brain is very fragile so if you're not well nourished in childhood the brain doesn't grow as well and worldwide children who grew up in poverty can have undernourished brains which makes them susceptible to all kinds of behavioral problems Particularly when it comes to prefrontal development as I mentioned that the prefrontal area is the one that manages emotions so if you can't handle your rage for instance many people who end up in murderers row who have killed someone have a damage to the prefrontal areas it's been found so we need to face this as you suggest starkly and see what the problems are and what the possible interventions might be because I would never write off an entire group of Children I would say instead these are developing brains let's help them develop as well as they could and in fact I mentioned that the New Zealand study suggested that we have active interventions particularly an early childhood there's a famous study done in the it's called the Perry PE rry preschool study where children hadn't written children from a neighborhood like this at a very enriched program and they did much much better in life than Other kids from the same neighborhood and the question of IQ and class is very important to understand in cultures worldwide where there's a privileged caste or class and an underprivileged caste or class there was always a wide gap in IQ scores between the privileged and the underprivileged and it's taken to be genetic however there's something called the Flynn effect Flynn is a researcher at the University of Otago in New Zealand and he's shown with vast Datasets that every three four five years when IQ tests are revised they have to make questions harder they have to make questions harder because kids become smarter every generation than previous generations in other words it's not fixed the other thing he's found is that when children a group from a caste which is our class which is underprivileged migrates to a country were the bias about that caste class doesn't exist their children do as Well as other children so it's not genetic it's largely situational so you're absolutely right we have to look squarely at those situations and see what we can do to help where is the mic next question hello there thank you for your talk very much enjoyed it my question relates back to the the situation of the marshmallows and you said if you give one child one yes before you all to have one one and if one eats one later then he'll have two And you said when they got to their 30s you know the high achievers were the ones who waited right how much of that is linked to addiction you mean wanting the two marshmallows right away you could get addicted to marshmallows I think no but is that youth yes yeah exactly the inability to control impulse makes one susceptible to alcoholism addiction Shopaholic gambling addiction and so on because you you want the hit and you you don't restrain yourself and See that there are other ways to go yeah by the way don't try that at home with your child the marshmallow test I know someone who tried it with his four-year-old daughter and he peeked to see what she did he put the marshmallow and left the room she took the marshmallow she took out the middle of the marshmallow and ate it and then put it back she's probably CEO of a company now I died I have good news good news and bad news if the brain becomes anatomically mature in the mid-20s but doesn't mean it's too late to change habit however habits instantiated in the brain in childhood are very strong so if you end up say addicted or overly anxious or whatever it may be it's still possible to change but you need to make an added effort and the reason is that you have to practice the new healthy better behavior over and over because you've Practiced the bad way 10,000 times you know you've done it over and over in the circuitry is so strong but here cross your arms this is what a habit feels like now cross them the other way with the other arm on top that's what it feels like to change a habit it's a little weird at first little that's strange but if you make the effort and keep making the effort at every naturally occurring opportunity what happens is the neural connectivity For the new pathway gets stronger and stronger until at some point you pass a developmental landmark a neural landmark where you do the new habit you perform the new habit effortlessly without thinking about it becomes automatic and what that means is that the connectivity for the new habit has now become stronger than the old one it's the brains now the brains default choice but takes work takes more work my question is about the three focuses that you Mentioned the inner the other and the answer I won I'm wondering whether they exist in isolation or whether they exist in a hierarchy and if so is there a method of moving through them well I think they each can be improved I don't think there's a hierarchy because for example in research on leaders we found that some leaders can be very good at any two or one of them and bad any of the others right in other words every combination is possible you can be Really emotionally intelligent manage yourself well manage other people well but be absolutely blind to systems and to the larger context in which your organization is operating or you can be very good at managing yourself and very bad at reading people there are actually a lot of in the workplace there is a whole class of people who are outstanding individual contributors often very good at systems and work very hard computer programmers for example Who have zero empathy I was talking to someone here in Europe who was with the company and he said we have a guy who is absolutely brilliant at systems and we can't put him in front of a client because when we do he just starts talking non-stop he never stops to you know meet the client to find out what's on their mind to understand the problem from their point of view so here's someone who's very good at inner and managing himself And its systems but not people is you mean is attention handled differently within different or value differently absolutely sure oh yeah I mean culture that the culture makes an enormous difference particularly for example in valuing attention attention training most of the attention training methods we use now come from Eastern cultures because because Eastern cultures like Bhutan for example many people in Bhutan and meditators may be To some extent almost all of them all of the citizens it's part of the culture it's part of the background and so the methodologies they have were quite sophisticated they've been developed over millennia and people like Richard Davidson who I mentioned who do research in this area are using expert advisors from those cultures to help him understand what is what the potential is for us to train attention because in the West we're rather stunted in our view of How to train attention so I think when it comes to to a mental faculty culture makes an enormous difference the same thing just true by the way of emotions every every culture values and expresses emotions differently everyone universally has the same wiring for emotion our our emotions are contagious yes therefore should we spend more or less time with our angry colleagues should we be the American bus driver or the French monk should we save the world Or save ourselves hahahahaha well the French monk is actually good at saving everyone that's his mission but apart from that I think that it's important to understand the dynamic of sending and receiving emotions so there are several factors that determine in any given interaction who sins and who receives there are studies done for example where two strangers come into a lab they fill out a questionnaire mood questionnaire or How do you feel right now then they sit facing each other in silence for two minutes then they fill out the same genera turns out the person in that diet who's most emotionally expressive transmits his or her emotional state to the other person in two silent minutes so expressivity is very important on the other hand power matters in any human group it's natural to pay most attention to and put most importance on but the Most powerful person in that group says and does so emotions tend to spread from the person who has power outward what this means for example these are experiments done on Keynes if the leader of a team is in a very bad mood people on the team catch the mood and performance goes down if the leader of the team is in a very good mood a positive mood people catch that and performance goes up and this is true for business decisions for creativity for Physical coordination like putting up a tent so that's a second factor is the power relationship the third factor has to do with Mathieu Picard and that is how stable are you if you are going to go and be with your angry colleague are you stable enough in a positive state that like him you can bring or the bus driver you can bring him into that state are you gonna end up angry yourself so those are at least three factors that might determine the answer fascinated by The advocacy of social emotional learning yes and it would appear that there are many Western parents today who have glommed onto the same focus in prescribing ritalin for many of their kids can you take a minute and talk a little bit about you've described an organic approach to improving focus and I look forward to reading more about those but what are the impact of the over prescription of Ritalin what are the effect in this long-term Effects right so ritalin which of course is given to children who have so-called ADHD attentional deficit hyperactivity disorder you know 50 years ago they used to say well he's just a little boy he'll outgrow it but now it's a become a diagnostic category and there's some kids who have genuine problems paying attention they're not being helped by digital media as they are today they would be very helped by these lessons in cognitive control which Are very new and are just now being studied so they're people like Davidson are studying the ways in which we can use attentional training think about it why has this culture had as its default buying a drug and giving it to our children for something which is a skill deficit it's a skill deficit tension is a skill I think the reason is there are drug companies who are making a lot of money selling us those drugs and convincing us that this is the better Alternative this is my personal opinion when in fact what we have not done is basic research on the attentional mechanisms involved in ADHD and what kind of training would help children get better at it and I think within the next five years we're going to see a set of very direct interventions that are non-pharmaceutical in those conditions I just wanted to ask your opinion is to what extent do you think our emotional reactions are learned or innate well our Emotions are innate I think and our particular emotional reactions are largely learned I have to recommend my wife's book here it's called mind whispering her name's Tara Bennett gomen she's a psychotherapist because she talks about the way in which emotional patterns of reactivity are learned in childhood and how you could use mindfulness cognitive therapy a number of interventions to change the habits that are self-defeating the name of the Book is mind whispering and her name is Tara Bennett goleman I found it very useful actually find her even more useful actually there's data on that if you're a pessimist can you learn to be an optimist and there's research done by a fella named Martin Seligman at University of Pennsylvania who developed a field called positive psychology he developed the field because psychology for 80 years only studied pathology so There was a problem we hadn't noticed that there was a positive spectrum of emotion and experience but any rate Seligman took kids who were prone to depression turned out that they tended to be pessimists and to see if they had something that didn't work out or a setback in life they'd say it's because of me and I'll always be like that and he taught them to think differently well it was the circumstance circumstances Can change and I can do something to change them it's a more optimistic outlook and he found that actually after about a year their thinking patterns had changed but it's what I said as with any such behavior we have to keep at it and keep at it at every naturally occurring opportunity and catch ourselves when we go back to the you know the old pattern so yes optimism can be learned I actually know the the gentleman who Invented cognitive therapy cognitive therapy looks at our thinking distorted thinking patterns and helps us see more realistically and it's very effective for depression his name is Aaron Beck he's 93 now he had a terrible accident that put him in a wheelchair and happened to speak to him after that and he was very upbeat he's supposed one of the most optimistic people I know then he lost sight in one eye and I was talking to me said well you know my Right eye works perfectly fine I can still run and then he went blind in his right eye and I said you know I can still listen to books on tape in other words he had the capacity to see what was right instead of what's wrong which is what you're talking about yes hi I just had a question about the performance graph that you have there yeah you mentioned two extremes you have the motivated performance and and then you Have the frazzle and yes what can you do if you're one of those types of people what can I do how can you improve it well we can do with this type of person and with this type of person yeah well let me ask you in this hypothetical question are we this type of person are we managing this type of person or a friend of this who are we are we the person a friend of this type of person today talking I have a friend here that all the days so what the person needs Who is under aroused who's disengaged is involvement to get more motivated more passionate more engaged and there's something there's a literature now on something called good work good work combines three things it combines what we're really good at our excellence with what we're really passionate about what engages us and what we value with our ethics if you align those three things you're naturally going to go up from here to there in fact you'll you'll get Into flow much more easily so one question to ask our friend is what would be good work for you and what could you do to make it a larger proportion of the time in your day or your week or your month or over the course of the next five years of your career so that's a kind of individual strategy for that if you're here if you're frazzle in frazzle what you need is calm so which is very related to cognitive control but there are many ways to calm down however if You can't well there are there two strategies if you're say frazzle because you have a boss that asks you to do too much in too little time and give too little support you might get your boss's CV and send it out to a headhunter but that's not an immediate solution so instead you might manage your own world better by finding something that works for you that gets you physiologically relaxed it might be meditation it might be yoga Might be deep muscle it might be working out at the gym everyone is different do it every day and do it before you go to work or whatever is frazzling you because what happens is that over time your body set point for stress changes and you'll be able to manage better or to be in a more relaxed state in in the circumstance two general strategies yes I've got two quick questions the first one might be a silly question so I apologize if I've Missed this but do you see focus as an extension of emotional intelligence or is it cognitive or is it is it both right so what I think is that attention was embedded within emotional intelligence because the brains circuits for emotions for empathy and for attention intermingle I just never thought about it I didn't realize I had to write a whole new book about it and tonight okay the second question is I've got a two-year-old son oh when he's four I fully intend to do the marshmallow just wandering between now and then are there things that I could be doing for him that will help him more be more likely to wait you're probably doing them already just being a good enough parent is terrific yeah but pay attention to you know your your child's feelings needs that's very important I wasn't entirely surprised to hear this from my friend a little while ago who works in a psychiatric resident hospital And the difference between the emotions of the sexes is absolutely enormous if a woman comes in for a session the psychotherapist will say how's it going how are you and I will come exactly how it's going how they feel when a man comes in very little is said so the psychotherapist will say on the sofa over there are a collection of soft toys pick why not hahahahaha so the man will go and pick up the Panda uh-huh and the Psychotherapist will say well how is mr. panda today and then it will come the difference of emotions between the sexes however we like to think we are basically all the same I think we are hugely different so do I thank you well I just wanted to make a response to the gentleman with the two-year-old I have three children and I'm sure that if all three coming out of exactly the same environment probably would react very differently to the marshmallow test so That goes back to my question is it learned or innate and I think often that some people just have a natural emotional intelligence yes I didn't answer question the answer is it's both learned and innate in that each of us is born with a particular range of set points in the brain chemicals that manage emotion that's our temperament and as you know if you have more than one child kids differ from day one on the other hand epigenetics tells us that It's not the genes you have it's which genes turn on and off that will make the lasting difference and the behavior in a child is very malleable so if a child is very impulsive that child can learn cognitive control if a child is too constricted that child could learn to loosen up there's data on children for example who are what are called behaviorally inhibited this is work of Jerome Kagan at Harvard he finds that about 15% of children are anxious Of new stimuli new playground new friend new food and when they're very young these are the kids who at school-age are identified as shy and it had been thought that this was just genetic but what they he realized wouldn't he followed a group of these kids was that some of them by school-age weren't shy and he looked at the parenting may God and he noted he found that the difference was this if your parents Identify you as she's shy and protect you those are the children who don't change if parents say to a child well you may feel a little timid about it but go ahead and try it anyway that child learns I'll feel little scared at first but if I go ahead I'm gonna have a good time and those are the children who don't end up shy so it's it's a malleable mix of both yeah and I think we've reached the end of our time Daniel I think you've them held our attention Brilliantly peace will you join me in thanking him for a really fascinating stimulating \[Applause\]  

我很高兴能来这里，谢谢你今晚的介绍 今晚我想提请大家注意，让我先讲个故事 这是关于社会心理学的一个经典实验 多年前在普林斯顿神学院对神学院学生进行的实验他们要准备一个题目 然后去另一栋楼布道，接受评估 一半学生的题目是好撒玛利亚人的寓言 这个人停下来帮助路边需要帮助的陌生人他们经过一个弯腰痛苦呻吟的人 有趣的问题是他们有没有停下来帮忙 更有趣的问题是他们思考好撒玛利亚人的寓言重要吗？这或多或少就是我们生活中的故事 有一个光谱，从注意到他人到融入他人 再到感同身受，理解他们的处境 如果他们有需要，我们可以做些什么 同情他们，也许可以帮助他们这就是当今注意力的问题所在，它受到了围攻 我想我知道我们有麻烦的那一刻，是在我开始写这本书之前 我在去参加一个会议的路上，我在开车，我住在新英格兰的乡下 我迟到了，但我想让那里的人知道所以我在开车的路上给他们发短信，这太可怕了，因为不久之后我读到，开车时发短信和开车时喝酒是一样的，非常糟糕，事实上在我所在的州，这是非法的。我喜欢谷歌学术，因为它可以让你访问学术数据库，所以我打开了浏览器，我的浏览器向我展示了当天的新闻，我是个新闻迷，所以我突然开始阅读新闻故事，在我意识到之前，我已经看了很多了。今天，我们都在同一条船上，我们使用的工具，我们的电脑，我们的手机等等，也都被设计用来打断我们，诱惑我们，把我们的注意力从这个吸引到那个，而那个下面通常是试图向我们推销什么东西的弹出式广告。弹出式广告当我四处拜访出版商，告诉他们我想写一本关于注意力的书时，一位出版商对我说，"太好了，我们很想出这本书，但你能不能写得简短一点？"2007年，我们遇到了什么？它指的是当你和某人在一起时，他拿出黑莓手机，开始和别人聊天，对你视而不见，这在2007年是不寻常的，但pizzle这个词已经和黑莓手机一起消亡了，因为现在这是新的社会规范，你去一家非常浪漫的餐厅吃饭，看到一对情侣在一起，他们都在看手机，而不是看着对方的眼睛，我们身上发生了一些事情。我认为，我们已经进入了一个面临有意贫乏危险的时代，其迹象不只是你知道的一对夫妇在看手机，而不是看着对方的眼睛。孩子想吸引她的注意力 她却忙着发短信 他根本没空 你知道的，当然爸爸也是一样 去年夏天，我在新英格兰海岸边的玛莎葡萄园岛度假七个联谊会的大学生姐妹一起去度周末 我们上了一辆共享出租车，一辆大面包车 我们上了出租车，一两分钟内 每个联谊会姐妹都盯着屏幕上的苹果手机/iPad我觉得这是很重要的 和谐的要素有三个 第一是相互全神贯注 从全神贯注中产生第二个要素两个人的身体看起来就像编排好的一样 这是由一类叫做振荡器的脑细胞管理的 振荡器控制着我们对别人的反应 我们对实物的反应 振荡器对人类的生存非常重要 与人交流是一种相当愉悦的状态，这些时刻是我们生命中最丰富的时刻，也是最重要的时刻，不过最近《哈佛商业评论》上有一篇文章，叫做 "人的时刻"，它说如果你想与人建立真正的联系，如果他们走进你的办公室，或者记住这一点如果他走进你的办公室，或者记住这一点，就请离开你的屏幕，忽略你的手机和其他所有设备，停止你的白日梦或其他任何想法，全神贯注于你面前的人，我发现，我们不得不在《哈佛商业评论》上发表一篇文章来告诉我们这样的事情，但事情已经到了这一步，因为注意力是一种越来越稀缺的商品，但它又是一种非常珍贵的商品。我认为现在是时候了，我们应该在生活中采取积极的态度 来抵制这种微妙的冲击，比如我认识一对夫妇，他们回家后就约定 把手机放在抽屉里，晚上不看手机我不知道这种情况在英国是否发生过，但在美国，比如当人们聚在一起吃饭时 每个人都会把手机拿出来，放在桌子中间，账单来之前谁先拿手机谁就得买单。最明显的是选择性注意 当我们专注于一件事而忽略其他事时 有两种主要的分心因素 两大类 一类是感官分心因素 所以如果你在看我 你可能没注意到这块白板 对吗 这相对容易我们的情绪干扰因素非常强大 它们是关于那次不太顺利的谈话的想法 今天早上我和我的搭档发生了争吵我们的思维游离越少，或者说学生在阅读文章时思维越现代，我们对文章的理解就越好，但事实证明，我们在阅读一本书时，平均有百分之二十到四十的时间思维会游离，我认为这取决于书的内容，这项研究是针对《傲慢与偏见》进行的。如果研究的是 "五十度灰 "或 "眨眼 "之类的书，结果可能会不一样，但问题是，注意力越是分散，尤其是对年轻人来说，他们就越难掌握和建立累积的心智模式，从而达到精通的程度。我想让你们注意一下注意力的模式 这里是一个示意图 这是一般情况下成绩之间的关系 比如说这是高的 这是低的 这是水平线 是大脑活动 特别是压力荷尔蒙的水平 比如说皮质醇 肾上腺素当注意力达到百分之百 甚至百分之百零的时候表现最好 这就是所谓的 "流" 研究人员发现了 "流" 对于那些不了解 "流 "的人来说 研究人员询问了许多不同领域的专家 篮球运动员 芭蕾舞演员 神经外科医生有一个神经外科医生说，我必须做一个手术，我不知道自己能不能做这个手术，这个手术太难了，但我做得非常好，我自己都很惊讶。我问发生了什么事，他们说你在给屋顶做手术的时候，你没有在那边，你也没有注意到 这就是那种注意力，这就是 "坚不可摧"，这也是一种状态，在这种状态下，你的技能被要求发挥到极致，无论要求是什么，你都能满足它。非常灵活，适应力强，而且很有说服力 这是一种感觉很好的状态，它就像融洽的关系 融洽的关系就是相互流动 人与人之间的流动我不知道你是否熟悉 "焦虑"，我经历过很多次，那是一种持续的压力。这就是情绪的力量，情绪会控制注意力，引导注意力，如果情绪太强烈，你就永远无法集中注意力，工作效率就会很低，因为人们缺乏动力，脱离工作、500 人收到了一个 iPhone 应用程序，该程序会在一天中的任意时间响铃，然后他们会回答两个问题：你现在在做什么？ 现在的差异当然很大 作为对思想游离的测量 结果发现平均有50%的时间 我们的思想在游离 专注度最高的一项活动是做爱如果你不专注于你正在做的事情，你的皮质醇水平就会过低，所以我一直在谈论专注，好像它是唯一有价值的注意力，但实际上，思绪游离是专注的敌人。如果你的思维在游离，那么你就没有集中注意力，反之亦然 思维游离对创造性洞察力来说绝对是必不可少的 创造性过程要求你首先收集信息，专注于问题，真正集中注意力，然后放手 科学、艺术和数学史上有很多人在洗澡时做白日梦，在公交车上遛狗时想出了不可思议的解决方案这就是创造性行为的定义，当然，如果你要执行，如果你要把想法付诸实践，那么你就必须回到焦点上，但思维徘徊是非常非常有价值的。我认为，领导者需要三种专注才能真正有效 第一种是内在专注 让我给你们讲一个神经病学的案例他得了前额叶小脑瘤，发现得很早，手术很成功，但手术后他的情况很让人费解，因为他和以前一样聪明，智商很高，在紧张和记忆力方面没有问题，但他不能再做他的工作了，他不能做任何工作了，事实上，他最后失业了，他的妻子离开了他，失去了他的家他的妻子离开了他 他失去了家 他住在他哥哥的空房间里 在绝望中 他去看了一位著名的神经学家 安东尼奥-达马西奥 达马西奥专门研究前额叶区域之间的回路特别是杏仁核，它是我们的危险雷达 它会触发我们强烈的情绪 他们切断了前额叶区和情绪中心之间的联系 迪马西奥起初很困惑 他意识到这个人在所有的神经测试中都很好达马西奥说，当我们做决定的时候 任何决定，什么时候做下一个决定 我是否应该离开我的工作 对于另一个决定 我们未来应该采取什么策略收集这些生活经验的回路 是非常基础的大脑回路 它在大脑中非常古老 它与大脑中的语言思维部分没有直接联系 它与卡斯特罗肠道和肠道有非常丰富的联系他们对加利福尼亚的企业家进行了研究，问他们如何做出决定，这些人从一无所有到拥有数亿或数十亿美元的资产，他们或多或少都说了同样的策略 我是一个贪婪的信息收集者，我想看到数字，但如果感觉不对，我就不会继续交易我认识一个人，我在加利福尼亚州的中央山谷的一个农场长大，我的高中在隔壁镇上有一所竞争对手的高中，我认识了他，他去了那所高中，他几乎不是一个好学生，他几乎不及格，没有毕业，差点就没有高中毕业，他去了一所两年制的社区大学，我们称之为 "社区大学"。他的学生作品引起了一位导演的注意 这位导演让他做助理 他做得很好 这位导演安排他执导自己的电影 别人的剧本他觉得自己是个有创造力的艺术家 而他们亵渎了他的艺术 他说我要自己做这部电影 我要自己融资他读到的侏儒是他的正直，这种内在意识是道德的，它是一个道德作家，你知道它回答的问题是，我将要做的事是否符合我的意义、价值观和道德感，这不是一个我们先用语言回答的问题，我们先回答什么感觉是对的，什么感觉是不对的，然后我们再用语言表达出来。今天的每一位领导者都需要一个强大的道德舵手 所以我认为内在的意识和内在的关注是至关重要的 还有一个关注点就是能够读懂别人 能够与人沟通第一种是认知上的同理心 认知上的同理心意味着我了解你是如何思考问题的，你的心智模式，你是如何看待这个世界的，这意味着我能够用你真正理解的方式与你沟通，你能够真正与管理者产生共鸣，能够用良好的认知上的同理心与他人交流的领导者，能够从人们身上获得比预期更好的绩效，因为他们知道如何调动他们，他们知道什么是最重要的。如果你只有认知上的共鸣，而没有情感上的共鸣，你就会错失良机。 第三种共鸣也非常重要，那就是同理心，我不仅知道你的想法和感受，还知道你需要什么，我可以帮你解决。哈佛商业评论》（Harvard Business Review）上有一篇文章叫做 "领导力失控"（Leadership run amok）。第三种关注是外部关注，这一点非常重要，例如，在制定战略时，你需要了解你的组织所处的生态系统，你需要能够感觉到什么是可行的，什么是我们未来需要做的，等等。在开发过程中，你会利用一个运作得非常好的产品或品牌，并对其进行微调、调整，不断使其变得更好，因为它一直在为你工作，这就是黑莓的做法。如果你没有内在的专注力、其他的专注力和外在的专注力，你就会陷入无舵状态，毫无头绪，或者一叶障目。我想我会告诉你怎么做，如果你有兴趣，只需花两分钟，你要做的就是坐直闭上眼睛，把注意力集中到呼吸上，不要试图控制呼吸，只要观察呼吸，试着感觉呼吸的进出，也许是你的鼻孔，观察每一次呼吸的全进全出完全呼出如果你发现你的思绪跑到别的地方去了，就把它带回来，轻轻地重新开始，现在你可以睁开眼睛了，但有没有人注意到他们的思绪在游离，有没有人把它带回来？这是在埃默里大学做的一项研究 这是大脑的基本肌肉 我觉得有趣的是 我们通常不锻炼它 我们依赖外部事物来吸引我们的注意力大脑会节约注意力 而定向则是开放性的 每当大脑遇到新奇的事物 就会兴奋起来 想想看 每一季都有新时尚 什么是新时尚 其实就是基本产品的细微变化这是个非常激进的举动 培养你管理自己思想的能力 这样你就能随意定向 但这正是紧张训练所能实现的 我是它的忠实拥护者当我们处于非常积极的状态时，我感觉非常好，今天真是美好的一天，左侧有很多活动，右侧没有活动，我们每个人在休息时都有一个右左活动的租借比率。他发现这有个钟形曲线 就像智商一样 我们大多数人都在中间 我们有糟糕的一天 我们也有好的一天 如果你非常靠右 你可能会临床抑郁或临床焦虑 如果你非常靠左 你非常有弹性 你会从挫折中反弹回来津恩，他将正念作为一种管理慢性病的方法，在医疗领域大受欢迎，最近在租赁行业，很多企业也开始使用正念，这和我们刚才做的差不多。他们教人们如何做正念运动 也就是观察呼吸的运动 但他们每天做30分钟，持续8周 他发现，在此之前，人们的大脑都是向右倾斜的 他们很烦躁，压力很大换句话说，积极的情绪真的起了作用 这也是企业引入它的原因之一 我自己觉得，最需要这种关注的不是我们成年人，而是孩子们，因为童年已经改变了我曾和一位八年级的老师聊过，她抱怨说，在美国，孩子们现在都在发短信，我不知道在这里，短信已经取代了电话，成为青少年之间联系的首选方式，他们的孩子每天会给朋友们发上百条短信。她说，在过去的两三年里，我的学生开始说他们读这本书有困难，有点太难了，她把这归因于理解能力的丧失，因为这种持续的分心，我看到一个大概九岁或十岁的孩子骑着自行车，一边骑车一边发短信，你能相信吗，幸运的是这是在乡下的乡间小路上。 大脑是人体解剖学上最后一个成熟的器官，它从出生时就开始生长，实际上要到 20 多岁才结束。当我们看到孩子成长并经历不同的童年阶段时，我们看到的是大脑成长的外部迹象，我认为我们有责任帮助孩子以最佳方式塑造他们的大脑。我曾在曼哈顿西班牙哈莱姆区的七岁儿童课堂上听课 西班牙哈莱姆区是个非常贫穷的地方 孩子们住在住宅区，环境非常恶劣我碰巧在那里看了一个叫 "呼吸小伙伴 "的节目 这间教室里的孩子们每天都要做一个动作 他们到自己的小房间里找一个最喜欢的毛绒玩具 把它放在地板上的地毯上他们所做的和我们刚才所做的一模一样 他们正在加强注意力的能力老师说，你知道吗，有一天因为时间安排的问题，我们不得不跳过这节课，结果班上乱成一团，所以这对这些孩子来说有很大的不同。我一直提倡所谓的社会情感学习，社会情感学习将情商的组成部分自我意识、管理自己的内心世界、同理心、处理人际关系作为课程的一部分，而不是以一种剥夺学业的方式，而是以一种提高孩子们处理自己和人际关系的能力的方式，如果你的天堂需要告诉你这些，那么从青春期开始，在青春期之前，孩子生命中最重要的关系是家庭。其他孩子和童年的戏剧性事件，他们没有邀请我参加聚会，不管是什么，我都会抓住注意力，这些都是情绪上的不稳定，你越能控制这些不稳定，你就越能集中注意力听老师讲课。在纽黑文的一个与西班牙哈莱姆区非常相似的社区里，每间教室的墙上都贴着一张海报，上面写着 "停止"，就像交通信号灯一样，红灯黄灯绿灯。冷静下来意味着你可以控制内心的骚动 在行动前思考是非常有价值的一课 因为它说你不能决定你会有什么情绪 我们的情绪会不请自来 但一旦你有了情绪 你就可以停下来想想你要做什么黄灯 想想你可以做的一系列事情，以及可能产生的后果 绿灯 选一个最好的，试一试 这是一堂认知控制课岁斯坦福大学的一项传奇心理学研究 四岁的孩子被带到一个房间里 一个接一个地坐在小桌子上 大块多汁的棉花糖放在他们面前我向你保证，我看过这方面的视频 有些孩子会上去闻一闻，觉得太危险了，然后跳回来 有些孩子会跑到角落里唱歌跳舞，分散注意力还有三分之一的孩子在无尽的1012分钟等待中 直到实验者回来，他们得到了两块棉花糖 14年后，当他们即将上大学时，这项研究的成果出现了结果发现，等待的孩子与同龄人相处得更好 他们仍然能够延迟满足感，追求自己的目标 这正是对他们的测试如果你不能控制自己的冲动和思绪如果你不能控制自己的冲动和思绪游荡 那你就会变得更烦躁 更情绪化 你就不能专心听老师讲课 所以你就学不好从4岁到8岁，他们接受了严格的认知控制测试，包括棉花糖类型的测试，然后当他们30多岁时，他们再次进行追踪调查，结果发现认知控制能力，即保持你的思想在这里或当它游荡时把它带回来的能力，是预测30多岁时经济成功和健康的更好指标事实上，做这项研究的人认为，我们应该向孩子们传授这种能力，以便创造公平的竞争环境，因此这也成为社会情感学习的一部分。在纽黑文，11 岁的男孩们要去踢我们所说的足球，我想你们错误地把它叫做橄榄球，是这样吗？这三个孩子要去踢球，第一个孩子有点胖，不太爱运动，后面两个孩子很会踢球，非常爱运动，他们对第一个孩子冷嘲热讽。我觉得这很容易导致学校里的一场争斗，于是他转过身说，是的，我想踢足球，但我踢得不好，我擅长的是美术，给我看什么都行，我可以把她画得很好，但你踢得很好，有一天我也想变得和你一样好，说到这，另一个孩子就融化了，他走上前来，搂着他的胳膊说，哦，你也不是那么糟糕，让我给你看一两样东西吧，那可不是偶然的，那叫 "放"。这是博伊德在他的塞尔中学到的，是一种处理 "撂倒 "的方法。当你抱起哭闹的婴儿并安抚她时，你实际上是在教她如何自我安抚，当你向蹒跚学步的孩子指出，你这样做让你的朋友很难过时，你实际上是在教她如何换位思考。注意力和情商方面的课程很早就开始了，但我认为我们必须在这方面做得更好，原因之一是孩子们受到的影响越来越大，而这些影响并不是那么好，我不知道你是否知道有哪个孩子喜欢电子游戏，而且一玩就是几个小时，也许这并不发生在伦敦，但这是个世界性的大问题。如果你是一个喜欢玩格斗游戏的孩子，你知道战斗游戏，你必须时刻警惕敌人，他们可能会突然出现并杀死你如果你是一个喜欢玩格斗游戏的孩子，你知道战斗游戏，你必须时刻警惕敌人，因为他们可能会突然出现并杀死你。但是，新一代的视频游戏正在出现，它采用了认知科学的研究成果，有一款名为 "顽强 "的游戏，我让我的四个孙子玩过，当时他们的年龄在 7 到 13 岁之间。如果你做到了，你就会得到一个视觉奖励 你知道沙漠里盛开的花朵 随着你做得越来越多，就会越来越难 所以基本上它的作用是训练注意力 但它能保持孩子们的注意力我是一名改过自新的记者 媒体让我们对世界有一种非常有毒的看法 我们得到的大多数新闻都是关于灾难 死亡威胁 发生在人们身上的可怕事情你知道，妈妈喂孩子吃饭就是善举 我们会把它放在一个刻度上 然后把所有残暴的行为放在失败的刻度上 善举会远远超过卑鄙的行为芝麻街 我在参观芝麻工作坊时发现 芝麻街实际上是一个非常复杂的机构 我去的那天，编剧正在和两位认知科学家开会 他们实际上在讨论认知控制问题本季播出的片段之一是饼干鉴赏家俱乐部 我知道如果你熟悉饼干怪兽 饼干怪兽是芝麻街的明星之一，他喜欢狼吞虎咽地吃饼干 但在芝麻街经营商店的艾伦决定成立一个饼干鉴赏家俱乐部然后闻闻它的香味 再啃一口尝尝它的味道 饼干怪兽当然很想进这个俱乐部 艾伦给了他一块饼干 他立刻狼吞虎咽地吃了起来两到四岁的孩子很喜欢这个节目 两到四岁的孩子主要是通过模仿来学习 饼干的作用就是让孩子们学习认知控制 我觉得这样的事情越多越好他的朋友 她是巴斯德研究所的细胞生物学博士 他的导师因为他们的研究获得了诺贝尔奖 但是研究生毕业后 他做了一个惊人的决定到他是世界上研究面部情绪表达的专家 他是最敏锐的面部观察者 他是一个非常危险的人 我有一次和保罗一起走在街上 在去我主持的一个会议的路上 保罗告诉我一个他刚刚开发出来的 训练人们做好这个的系统我想这真的很有趣 但我希望他能把它讲完 我得想想我在会议上要做什么 他对我说 如果有人研究过这个系统 就会知道你现在对我有点生气 这就是为什么 "拍拍 "如此危险在他任教的大学里，他对教员们进行了一次调查 问谁是我们教员中最粗暴、最难对付的人 很奇怪，每个人都认为他是最难对付的人 所以他把X教授称为王牌 为了科学的利益，你愿意参加一个科学实验吗？于是他们不得不甩掉他，换了第二位最难对付的教授 实验是他们两个都让马修和教授测量生理指标 然后他们要进行一场辩论 辩论的前提是教授应该像马修那样做但辩论的前提是他要放弃这个职位 去当和尚，去赫米蒂奇度过余生 辩论开始时 生理机能显示他一想到这个就很激动我有一次在纽约等公交车，那是八月的一天，天气非常潮湿闷热，我不知道伦敦是怎样的天气，但在纽约，我们身边有一个无形的气球，我们感觉有点刺痛，气球上写着不要和我说话，不要碰我，我的气球完好无损，公交车停了下来，我和我的气球一起上车，公交车司机做了一件非常令人惊讶的事情，他居然和我说话了，他说他们班德怎么样？我吓了一跳，但我还是坐了下来，把我的气球带走了 然后我意识到，公交车司机在和车上的每个人交谈 你在找西装吗？ 你知道吗，在右边的百货商店里有个大减价 你听说过左边的莫内展览吗？然后人们下车，他会对他们说，我希望你们今天过得很愉快 那个人是个城市圣人，他改变了车上的每个人 他在这个急需美好情感的城市里荡漾着美好的涟漪你提到了美国的低俗文化 那里每天都有谋杀案发生 史蒂芬-平克很好地描写了一些这样的文化 他解释说，人们会因为一个简单的轻微的 不尊重或其他事情而被杀，这在文化中根深蒂固我看到的是，当今世界似乎存在着一种阴险的政治正确性，我们不能说某种文化是垃圾文化，这样做我们就不能解决这些人的问题，所以他们每天都在继续着低期望值、谋杀、社会美利亚。我想知道您对人们无法诚实、公开地解决这些问题有何看法，甚至对我们的许多状况是遗传的这一事实有何看法？是的，我知道有一些数据直接说明了这一点，我认为首先我们必须非常谨慎地对待刻板印象，因为在任何特定的社区里，碰巧生活在那里的人都会有一定的差异。可能会有一些非常有才华的年轻人生活在一个充满问题的社区，所以我们应该考虑到个体差异。在世界范围内，在贫困中长大的儿童的大脑可能营养不良，这使他们容易出现各种行为问题 特别是在前额叶发育方面，正如我提到的，前额叶是管理情绪的区域因此，正如你所建议的那样，我们需要直面这个问题，看看问题出在哪里，以及可能的干预措施是什么。事实上，我提到新西兰的研究建议我们采取积极的干预措施，特别是在幼儿期，有一项著名的研究，叫做佩里学前教育研究，在这项研究中，孩子们没有写出他们的前额区损伤。智商和阶级的问题是非常重要的，在世界范围内，有特权种姓或阶级和弱势种姓或阶级的文化中，特权阶层和弱势阶层之间的智商分数总是有很大的差距。他用大量的数据表明，每隔三四五年，智商测试就会进行一次修订 他们必须把问题做得更难，因为孩子们每一代都比上一代更聪明 换句话说，这不是固定不变的所以你说得很对，我们必须正视这些情况，看看我们能做些什么来帮助他们 下一个问题是麦克风在哪里 你好，谢谢你的演讲，我很喜欢，我的问题又回到了棉花糖的情况上，你说过如果你给一个孩子一个，是的，在你之前，你所有的孩子都有一个，如果一个孩子后来吃了一个，那么他就会有两个，你还说过当他们到了30多岁的时候，你知道成绩好的人都是那些等待的人，对吗?你的意思是想马上吃两块棉花糖 你会对棉花糖上瘾吗？ 我想不会，但那是年轻人吗？ 是的，没错，无法控制冲动使人容易酗酒成瘾 购物狂赌博成瘾等等他偷看她做了什么 他把棉花糖放好，然后离开了房间 她拿起棉花糖，把中间的棉花糖拿出来吃了 然后又放回去了但这并不意味着改变习惯为时已晚，因为在童年时期大脑中形成的习惯是非常强大的，所以如果你最终上瘾或过度焦虑，或者不管是什么，你仍然有可能改变，但你需要付出更多的努力，原因是你必须反复练习新的健康的更好的行为，因为你已经练习了10、000次了，你知道你一遍又一遍地做这个动作，你的神经回路就会变得非常强大，但在这里，交叉你的手臂，这就是习惯的感觉，现在把你的手臂交叉到另一边，另一只手臂放在上面，这就是改变习惯的感觉，一开始有点奇怪，但如果你努力并在每个自然发生的机会中不断努力，就会发生这样的事情：新通路的神经连接会变得越来越强大，直到某个时候，你通过了一个发展里程碑我的问题是关于你提到的三个焦点 一个是内在的 另一个是我得到的答案 我想知道它们是孤立存在的我认为它们每一个都可以改进，但我不认为有等级之分，因为例如，在对领导者的研究中，我们发现有些领导者可能在其中任何两个或一个方面都非常出色，而在其他方面却很糟糕。实际上，在工作场所，有很多人都是杰出的个人贡献者，他们往往非常擅长系统，工作非常努力，比如计算机程序员，他们的同理心为零。他从不停下来和客户交流，了解他们在想什么，从他们的角度去理解问题，所以这个人很擅长内在管理和自我管理，但他的系统却不是人，你的意思是说，在不同的企业里，注意力的处理方式是不同的，或者说价值是不同的，绝对肯定的，哦，是的，我是说文化，文化带来了巨大的差异特别是在重视注意力的训练方面 我们现在用的大部分注意力训练方法都来自东方文化 因为东方文化比如不丹 很多不丹人和冥想者在某种程度上都是这样的 几乎所有的人都是这样像我提到的理查德-戴维森（Richard Davidson）就是这方面的研究者，他利用这些文化中的专家顾问来帮助他了解我们训练注意力的潜力所在，因为在西方，我们对如何训练注意力的认识相当滞后，所以我认为当涉及到心理能力时，文化会产生巨大的影响。文化对心理能力的影响是巨大的 同样的道理，对情绪的影响也是如此 每种文化对情绪的重视和表达方式都不尽相同 每个人都有相同的表达情绪的方式 我们的情绪具有传染性我们应该做美国公交车司机还是法国僧侣 我们应该拯救世界还是拯救我们自己 哈哈哈哈 其实法国僧侣很擅长拯救每个人，这是他的使命 但除此之外，我认为重要的是要了解发送和接收情绪的动态 所以在任何给定的互动中有几个因素决定例如，有研究表明，两个陌生人来到实验室 填写一份情绪问卷或 "你现在感觉如何 "问卷因此，表达能力非常重要。另一方面，权力也很重要，在任何人类群体中，最关注和最重视的自然是群体中最有权力的人的一言一行，因此情绪往往会从有权力的人向外扩散。这意味着什么？ 例如，这些是在凯恩斯身上做的实验，如果一个团队的领导者心情很差，团队中的人就会受到影响，工作表现就会下降，如果团队的领导者心情很好，积极向上，团队中的人就会受到影响，工作表现就会上升。第三个因素与马修-皮卡德有关，那就是如果你要去和你愤怒的同事在一起，你的情绪稳定程度如何？所以，至少有三个因素可以决定你的答案 社会情感学习的倡导让人着迷 是的，而且现在似乎有很多西方父母也在为他们的孩子开利他林的处方，你能不能花一分钟谈谈你的看法？ 我很期待能读到更多相关的文章，但过量服用利他林会有什么影响？ 长期服用会有什么影响？50年前，人们会说，他只是个小男孩，会慢慢长大的，但现在，这已经成为了一种诊断范畴，有些孩子在注意力方面确实存在问题，他们并没有像今天这样得到数字媒体的帮助，他们会得到认知控制课程的帮助，这些课程非常新颖，现在才刚刚被研究出来，所以像戴维森这样的人正在研究我们可以使用注意力训练的方法。我认为原因在于有一些药物公司赚了很多钱，他们向我们推销这些药物，并说服我们说这是更好的选择，这是我的个人观点，而事实上，我们还没有对多动症所涉及的注意力机制进行基础研究，以及什么样的训练可以帮助孩子们在这方面做得更好，我认为在未来五年内，我们将看到一系列非常直接的干预措施，这些干预措施是非药物性的。我想问问你的意见，你认为我们的情绪反应在多大程度上是后天习得的，还是与生俱来的？我认为我们的情绪是与生俱来的，而我们特定的情绪反应在很大程度上是后天习得的。这本书的名字叫《心灵低语》，她的名字叫塔拉-贝内特-戈尔曼（Tara Bennett goleman），我觉得这本书非常有用，实际上，我觉得她更有用，因为有数据表明，如果你是一个悲观主义者，你能不能学会做一个乐观主义者？因为心理学80年来一直只研究病理学 所以我们没有注意到情绪和经验也有积极的一面 但无论如何 塞利格曼研究了那些容易抑郁的孩子他发现，大约一年后，他们的思维模式发生了改变，但正如我所说的，对于任何行为，我们都必须坚持下去，抓住每一个自然发生的机会。是的，乐观是可以学会的。事实上，我认识一位发明认知疗法的先生，认知疗法关注我们扭曲的思维模式，帮助我们更现实地看待问题，对抑郁症非常有效。那次可怕的事故让他坐上了轮椅 之后我碰巧和他说过话 他非常乐观 他应该是我认识的最乐观的人之一换句话说，他有能力看到什么是对的，而不是什么是错的，这就是你所说的 是的，嗨，我只是有一个关于你那里的表现图的问题 是的，你提到了两个极端，你有积极的表现，然后你有焦躁，是的，你能做些什么呢？如果你是这类人，我该怎么做？ 你该怎么改进？ 我们可以和这类人一起做，也可以和这类人一起做 是的，让我问你一个假设性问题 我们是这类人吗？我有一个朋友，整天都在和我说话，所以这个人需要的是参与，他需要更多的动力，更多的激情，更多的参与。如果你把这三样东西结合起来，你就会自然而然地从这里走到那里 事实上，你会更容易进入状态，所以我们要问朋友的一个问题是，什么对你来说是好工作？在你的一天、一周、一月或未来五年的职业生涯中 你需要的是冷静，这是一种个人策略如果你因为上司要求你在太少的时间内做太多的事情而感到焦躁不安，上司给你的支持又太少，你可能会把上司的简历寄给猎头公司，但这并不是一个立竿见影的办法，所以你可以找到一些适合自己的方法，从而更好地管理自己的世界。可能是冥想，可能是瑜伽，可能是深层肌肉锻炼，可能是健身房锻炼 每个人的情况都不一样，每天都做，在上班前做，或者做任何让你焦虑的事情，因为随着时间的推移，你身体的压力设定值会发生变化，你就能更好地管理自己的世界。我有两个简单的问题，第一个可能是个愚蠢的问题，如果我错过了，请原谅，但你认为专注是情商的延伸，还是认知的延伸，还是两者兼而有之？我只是从来没有想过这个问题，我没有意识到我必须写一本关于这个问题的新书，今晚 好吧，第二个问题是，我有一个两岁的孩子。岁的儿子当他四岁的时候，我完全打算做棉花糖，只是从现在到那时，我可以为他做一些事情，帮助他更有可能等待，你可能已经在做了，做一个足够好的父母是非常好的，但要注意你知道你的孩子的感受需求，这是非常重要的。男女之间的情绪差异是非常大的 如果一个女人来接受治疗 心理治疗师就会说，你好吗？ 你好吗？心理治疗师会说，嗯，先生怎么样？今天的主题是 "熊猫"，接下来的主题是 "两性情感的差异"，不过，我们总以为我们基本上是一样的，但我认为我们有很大的不同。我有三个孩子，我敢肯定，如果三个孩子都来自完全相同的环境，他们对棉花糖测试的反应可能会大相径庭，所以这又回到了我的问题：这是后天习得的还是天生的？表观遗传学告诉我们，不是基因决定了孩子的性格，而是基因的开启和关闭决定了孩子的性格，孩子的行为具有很强的可塑性。他发现，大约 15%的儿童对新刺激、新游乐场、新朋友、新食物感到焦虑。这些孩子到了上学的年龄就会被认为是害羞的，人们一直认为这只是遗传的问题，但他发现，他跟踪了一群这样的孩子，发现其中一些孩子到了上学的年龄并不害羞。如果父母对孩子说，你可能会觉得有点胆怯，但无论如何都要去试一试，孩子就会知道我一开始会觉得有点害怕但如果我去了，就会玩得很开心 那些孩子最后就不会害羞了 所以这两者都是可塑之物 是的，我想我们的时间到了 丹尼尔，我想你已经吸引了我们的注意力 非常精彩，和平 请和我一起感谢他的精彩演讲
