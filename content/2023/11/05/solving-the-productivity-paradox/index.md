A few years ago, advertisements for a software service named Monday.com seemed to be suddenly everywhere online. This ubiquity didn’t come cheap. An S.E.C. filing revealed that the product’s developers had spent close to a hundred and thirty million dollars on advertising in 2020 alone, which amounted to roughly eighty per cent of the company’s annual revenue. The resulting blitz generated more than seven hundred and twenty-two million views on Monday.com’s YouTube channel—an audience larger than the preceding four Super Bowls combined.  

几年前，一个名为 Monday.com 的软件服务广告似乎突然在网上随处可见。这种无处不在的感觉并不便宜。美国证券交易委员会（S.E.C.）的一份文件显示，仅在 2020 年，该产品的开发商就在广告上花费了近 1.3 亿美元，约占公司年收入的 80%。周一网的 YouTube 频道由此产生了超过七亿二千二百万的浏览量--观众人数超过了前四届超级碗的总和。

This outsized investment makes sense when you consider the changes that have taken place in the productivity-software market. Monday.com claims to help knowledge workers collaborate better: “Boost your team’s alignment, efficiency, and productivity by customizing any workflow to fit your needs.” This objective might sound dry in our current moment of flashy social apps and [eerie artificial intelligence](https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/can-we-stop-the-singularity), but helping organizations manage their workflows has proved to be surprisingly lucrative. Trello, one of the early success stories from this category, was launched in 2011 as a side project by an independent software developer. In 2017, it was purchased by Atlassian for four hundred and twenty-five million in cash and stock. Another workflow-management service, named Wrike, subsequently sold for $2.25 billion. For its part, Monday.com went on to leverage the user growth generated by its advertising push to support a successful I.P.O. that valued the company at over seven billion dollars.  

如果考虑到生产力软件市场发生的变化，这笔巨额投资是合情合理的。Monday.com 声称可以帮助知识工作者更好地协作："通过定制任何适合您需求的工作流程，提高您团队的协调性、效率和生产力"。在我们这个充斥着华而不实的社交应用和阴森恐怖的人工智能的时代，这个目标听起来可能很枯燥，但事实证明，帮助组织管理他们的工作流程却出人意料地有利可图。Trello 是这一类别的早期成功案例之一，它于 2011 年由一名独立软件开发人员作为一个辅助项目推出。2017 年，它被 Atlassian 以 4.25 亿现金和股票收购。另一家名为 Wrike 的工作流程管理服务公司随后以 22.5 亿美元的价格出售。Monday.com则利用广告推动带来的用户增长，成功实现了I.P.O.，公司估值超过70亿美元。

What’s striking about this new generation of productivity software is not so much what it does, but what it doesn’t do. Until recently, most business applications focussed on providing faster and more powerful versions of the tools that knowledge workers were already using to accomplish their daily tasks—electronic spreadsheets were better than paper accounting ledgers, e-mail is better than fax machines. The new productivity services, by contrast, can’t be used to directly execute work. Their purpose is instead to help better _organize_ these efforts. Monday.com allows you to arrange “items,” described by various properties such as “status” or “percentage complete,” onto “boards.” You can then visualize the work described by these boards in various useful formats. Trello offers something similar, capturing items on virtual cards that can be dragged around into different vertical stacks. One stack might contain the tasks a team still needs to handle, while another might contain those already accomplished.  

新一代生产力软件的惊人之处不在于它能做什么，而在于它不能做什么。直到最近，大多数商业应用软件都把重点放在为知识工作者完成日常任务所使用的工具提供更快、更强大的版本上--电子表格优于纸质会计账簿，电子邮件优于传真机。相比之下，新的生产力服务不能直接用于执行工作。它们的目的是帮助更好地组织这些工作。Monday.com允许你将 "项目"（用 "状态 "或 "完成百分比 "等各种属性来描述）安排到 "板块 "上。然后，你可以用各种有用的格式将这些板块所描述的工作可视化。Trello 也提供了类似的功能，它可以在虚拟卡片上捕捉项目，并将其拖动到不同的垂直堆栈中。一个堆栈可能包含团队仍需处理的任务，而另一个堆栈可能包含已经完成的任务。

To understand the importance of this shift from work to workflow, it helps to understand two competing philosophies about how technology impacts productivity. The first argues that technology improves productivity by directly improving the tools that we work with—the waterwheel, the electric motor, and so on. A less-discussed but equally important philosophy broadens the definition of technology to include the more general systems by which work is organized. It argues that some of the biggest productivity breakthroughs come not from better tools but instead from smarter ways of arranging what you’re already doing. A canonical example is Henry Ford’s continuous-motion assembly line, developed at his automobile factory in Highland Park, Michigan. The assembly line was a productivity miracle, decreasing the worker hours required to produce a Model T by nearly a factor of ten. Its effectiveness, however, had less to do with ingenious new inventions than it did with an ingenious new insight about how to rearrange the manufacturing process: bringing the car to the worker instead of the worker to the car. “Be ready to revise any system, scrap any method, abandon any theory, if the success of the job requires it,” Ford explained.  

要理解从工作到工作流程这一转变的重要性，就必须了解关于技术如何影响生产力的两种相互对立的理念。第一种观点认为，技术通过直接改进我们的工作工具--水车、电动机等--来提高生产力。另一种讨论较少但同样重要的理念则扩大了技术的定义，将组织工作的更一般的系统也包括在内。它认为，一些生产力上的最大突破并非来自更好的工具，而是来自以更聪明的方式安排你已经在做的事情。一个典型的例子是亨利-福特在密歇根州海兰帕克的汽车厂开发的连续运动装配线。这条流水线创造了生产力奇迹，将生产一辆 T 型车所需的工时减少了近十倍。然而，它的成效与其说与独创性的新发明有关，不如说与如何重新安排生产流程的独创性新见解有关：把汽车带给工人，而不是把工人带给汽车。"福特解释说："如果工作的成功需要，随时准备修改任何系统，废除任何方法，放弃任何理论。

The change of focus in the business-software space from tools toward process-based productivity can be explained, in part, by the acknowledgment that the existing strategy of making applications increasingly powerful has stopped making us better at our jobs. During the past two decades or so—a period of rapid technology innovation, which produced laptops, smartphones, ubiquitous cloud computing, and Google—American productivity growth has suffered a sustained slowdown. We gained access to an armada of supercharged workplace tools, and yet we’re not getting much more done.  

商业软件领域的重心从工具转向基于流程的生产力，部分原因在于人们认识到，现有的让应用程序变得越来越强大的战略已经无法让我们更好地完成工作。在过去二十年左右的时间里，笔记本电脑、智能手机、无处不在的云计算和谷歌等技术创新层出不穷，美国的生产率增长却持续放缓。我们获得了一大批超级强大的工作场所工具，但我们却没有完成更多的工作。

There are many explanations for this paradox, including, notably, the theory that these tools counterbalanced new capabilities with new distractions.对这一悖论有很多解释，其中最主要的理论是，这些工具以新的干扰来抵消新的能力。 (E-mail is faster than a fax machine, but its spread also created a world in which we end up [checking our in-boxes constantly](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/was-e-mail-a-mistake).)  

(电子邮件比传真机更快，但它的普及也创造了一个我们不断检查收件箱的世界）。 Regardless of specific causes, what is clear is that this general failure of new technology to deliver results in the workplace presents a problem for software developers. If employers no longer believe that these products are significantly boosting their employees’ productivity, they’ll no longer pay top dollar to keep up with the latest versions. In the nineteen-nineties, Microsoft made a fortune from companies willing to invest in expensive standalone releases of their densely featured Office productivity software. Today, these same companies, less enamored with such tools’ productive potential, might instead settle for cheaper online variants. Why spend two hundred and forty-nine dollars for a single copy of Microsoft Office 2021 when business subscriptions to Google’s Web-based workplace tools start at six dollars per user?无论具体原因如何，显而易见的是，新技术在工作场所的普遍失败给软件开发商带来了难题。如果雇主不再相信这些产品能显著提高员工的工作效率，他们就不会再花高价购买最新版本。十九世纪九十年代，微软公司从愿意投资购买其功能密集的 Office 办公自动化软件昂贵的独立版本的公司那里赚得盆满钵满。如今，同样是这些公司，由于对这些工具的生产潜力不那么着迷，可能会选择更便宜的在线版本。既然谷歌基于网络的工作场所工具的企业订阅费从每个用户六美元起，为什么还要花两百四十九美元购买微软Office 2021的单机版呢？ (Perhaps reacting to these pressures, Microsoft now offers a free Web-based version of its once vaunted Office software.)  

(也许是为了应对这些压力，微软公司现在提供了基于网络的免费版 Office 软件（该软件曾经备受推崇）。

In this context, the move in business software toward process productivity comes across as a reasonable strategy. It presents a new and exciting pitch for the professional market—“It’s not the tools that matter, it’s the process!”—and new and exciting pitches are often better able to attract significant investment. If Microsoft Word was the waterwheel, in other words, maybe Monday.com can be the assembly line. This development should be received as good news. The process-centric philosophy of productivity had been largely missing from the world of office work. Whereas other economic sectors have long cared a lot about how effort is organized, knowledge-work managers, [for a combination of historically contingent reasons](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/office-space/the-frustration-with-productivity-culture), have traditionally left these details up to individuals. It wasn’t until the rapid expansion of the knowledge economy in the second half of the twentieth century that productivity suddenly became personal.  

在这种情况下，商业软件向流程生产力的转变是一种合理的战略。它为专业市场提供了一个全新的、令人兴奋的推销方式--"重要的不是工具，而是流程！"--而全新的、令人兴奋的推销方式往往更能吸引大量投资。换句话说，如果微软 Word 是水车，那么 Monday.com 也许可以成为流水线。这一发展应该是个好消息。在办公室工作领域，以流程为中心的生产力理念在很大程度上是缺失的。长期以来，其他经济部门非常关注工作的组织方式，而知识工作的管理者则由于历史上各种偶然的原因，传统上将这些细节留给个人处理。直到二十世纪下半叶知识经济的迅速发展，生产力才突然变得个人化。

This myopia is a [mistake](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-rise-and-fall-of-getting-things-done). Keeping productivity as an individual obligation, and focussing only on offering increasingly powerful tools, didn’t lead to a more efficient and relaxing workday, but instead enabled us to take on even more tasks, pursued with even more frantic intensity. It doesn’t have to be this way. More structured rules for determining who should be working on what, and how collaboration should best be organized, could walk us back from our current moment of always-on overload.  

这种近视是错误的。把提高工作效率作为个人的义务，只专注于提供功能越来越强大的工具，并没有带来更高效、更轻松的工作日，反而使我们能够承担更多的任务，以更疯狂的强度工作。其实大可不必如此。制定更有条理的规则来确定谁应该负责什么工作，以及如何更好地组织协作，可以让我们从当前永远在线的超负荷状态中解脱出来。

It’s here that the rise of process-centric productivity software might generate its most lasting impact. If tools like Monday.com, Trello, and Wrike continue to spread, they will carry in their wake an emphasis on the importance of process productivity. Whether or not these particular applications stick, this new mind-set might, and if it does, it would be a welcome transformation for a knowledge sector exhausted by the focus on tools over systems. These well-funded software companies, competing aggressively to become the next Microsoft, might just provide the strong push needed for the managerial class to realize that there’s more to productivity than simply giving their employees the latest spreadsheet and messenger software. It’s in rethinking how we organize our work, not just in how fast we can accomplish it, where the real improvements are to be found. Perhaps we’re finally ready to learn this reality. ♦  

在这里，以流程为中心的生产力软件的兴起可能会产生最持久的影响。如果Monday.com、Trello和Wrike等工具继续普及，它们就会强调流程生产力的重要性。无论这些特定的应用软件能否坚持下去，这种新的思维定势都有可能坚持下去，而如果真的坚持下去，对于一个因注重工具而非系统而疲于奔命的知识行业来说，这将是一个值得欢迎的转变。这些资金雄厚的软件公司都在为成为下一个微软而激烈竞争，它们可能会提供管理阶层所需的强大推动力，让他们意识到提高生产力不仅仅是给员工提供最新的电子表格和信使软件那么简单。我们应该重新思考如何组织工作，而不仅仅是以多快的速度完成工作，只有这样才能真正提高工作效率。也许我们终于准备好了解这一现实了。♦
