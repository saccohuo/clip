What makes you a good developer, will not necessarily make you a good manager. There are different skill sets needed to excel in one or the other. As you grow more and more as a developer, you need to find challenges for yourself.  

能让你成为一名优秀的开发人员，并不一定能让你成为一名优秀的管理者。二者需要不同的技能组合。随着你作为开发人员的成长，你需要为自己寻找挑战。

Especially when you are a senior for some time. Management is a different skillset that you need to develop and can be a great next step. In this article, I will share my story from IC (individual contributor) to manager.  

特别是当你成为资深开发人员一段时间后。管理是您需要培养的另一种技能，也是您下一步发展的重要方向。在本文中，我将分享我从 IC（个人贡献者）到经理的故事。

I’ve had the pleasure to be chatting with [Chris Blakey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisblakey/) on The Leadership Link podcast about this topic. [You can watch the full episode here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmx34u_fcx0)  

我有幸在《领导力链接》播客节目中与克里斯-布莱基（Chris Blakey）聊到了这个话题。您可以在这里观看全集。

This is us, having fun talking about this topic.  

这就是我们，开心地谈论这个话题。

A lot of people may feel daunted when talking about management, thinking that is not for them. But I’ll tell you how I knew that management might be for me.  

谈到管理，很多人可能会感到畏惧，认为那不适合自己。但我会告诉你我是如何知道管理可能适合我的。

I was always good at collaborating and communicating when it came to certain projects or functionalities. I wanted to always make sure we have the correct requirements and that we are building the right things.  

当涉及到某些项目或功能时，我总是善于合作和沟通。我希望始终确保我们的需求是正确的，我们所做的事情是正确的。

> **I wanted to fully understand the needs and find the best solutions that would fit these needs.  
> 
> 我希望充分了解需求，并找到满足这些需求的最佳解决方案。**

I also understood the importance of managing expectations. You can do the best work in the world, but if the expectations are not met correctly, all the effort is wasted. So I wanted to always ensure that this was done correctly.  

我还明白了管理期望值的重要性。你可以做世界上最好的工作，但如果不能正确地满足期望，所有的努力都会白费。因此，我希望始终确保正确地完成这项工作。

And that automatically brought me to the place where I wished to have a bigger impact on the projects and the team. Not only in details but also a lot more say in the direction and the overall team in general.  

这自动把我带到了希望对项目和团队产生更大影响的地方。不仅在细节方面，而且在方向和整个团队方面也有更多的发言权。

Like a lot of developers, I was contemplating a LOT regarding the direction of my career. The questions: “What is going to be that next step for me?” and “Should I go into management, architecture route or should I grow as an IC?” were always on my mind. I believe that my growth was stagnating because I didn’t know that.  

和许多开发人员一样，我也在思考自己的职业方向。这些问题"我的下一步该怎么走？"、"我应该进入管理层、走架构路线，还是作为集成电路开发人员继续发展？"这些问题一直在我的脑海中挥之不去。我相信，我的成长之所以停滞不前，是因为我不知道这一点。

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F514c9eee-fc9d-453c-b7d7-099fb2a0483d_800x500.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F514c9eee-fc9d-453c-b7d7-099fb2a0483d_800x500.jpeg)

I was always leaning more towards management, because of the reasons listed above. I was always good technically as well, but I was standing out from others because my main focus wasn’t on technical solutions and approaches.  

由于上述原因，我一直更倾向于管理层。我的技术能力也一直很强，但我之所以能从其他人中脱颖而出，是因为我的主要关注点不在技术解决方案和方法上。

After being an IC for some time, I’ve had discussions with my manager at the time that management might be the right path for me, but I wasn’t very convincing. The reason was that I was overthinking for far too long. As I found out later, my manager was surprised I was interested in the Team Lead role and that she thought that I wouldn’t be.  

在做了一段时间的集成电路之后，我曾与当时的经理讨论过，管理可能是适合我的道路，但我并没有很好地说服他。原因是我想得太久了。后来我才知道，我的经理很惊讶我对团队领导的职位感兴趣，她以为我不会感兴趣。

I was in the company for some time and had a track record of successfully delivering multiple projects. The company was going through the restructuring and there were new teams created.  

我在公司工作了一段时间，有成功交付多个项目的记录。当时公司正在进行重组，成立了一些新的团队。

My manager at the time approached me and offered me the Team Lead position, which I accepted. And yes, I didn’t know what I was getting myself into! It was quite a big change for me. let’s get into that next.  

当时我的经理找到我，让我担任组长一职，我接受了。是的，我不知道自己会陷入怎样的境地！这对我来说是一个很大的改变。

I didn’t know a lot about management at that time. I read a couple of books, but that was all. So naturally, I’ve made a lot of mistakes. What brought me to be a successful developer didn’t work for me well as I became a team lead.  

当时我对管理一无所知。我读过几本书，但仅此而已。因此，我自然犯了很多错误。让我成为一名成功的开发人员的方法，在我成为团队领导后并没有很好地发挥作用。

> **I tried to do too much overall.  
> 
> 总的来说，我想做的事情太多了。**

As a developer, I was so used to being in control, so naturally, I wanted to mimic this behavior when I first became a manager.  

作为一名开发人员，我已经习惯了掌控一切，所以当我第一次成为一名经理时，我自然也想模仿这种行为。

[![](https3A2F2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F94613282-e616-4da3-843f-f8f9f259db9d_800x426.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94613282-e616-4da3-843f-f8f9f259db9d_800x426.jpeg)

I wanted to be in all of the details and even minor things all the time. And also make decisions about everything. This brought that I didn’t delegate enough and I didn’t assign clear ownership and empower others.  

我想参与所有的细节，甚至是所有的小事。而且还事事都要做决定。这导致我没有足够的授权，也没有分配明确的所有权和授权给他人。

I learned that this is not the way to go when I was close to burnout. Working long hours and having so many things on my mind.  

当我接近职业倦怠时，我明白了这不是办法。工作时间长，脑子里想的事情太多。

Based on this experience I knew I needed to make a change. I knew that I needed to delegate more and also empower people to make decisions themselves.  

基于这次经历，我知道我需要做出改变。我知道我需要下放更多的权力，也需要赋予人们自己做决定的权力。

That’s when things started to look a lot better for me.  

就在那时，我的情况开始好转。

As said above, I made a lot of mistakes when first started as a manager, here are the 3 main ones:  

如上所述，我在刚开始担任经理时犯了很多错误，以下是三个主要错误：

1.  **Managing your time is really important  
    
    时间管理非常重要**
    

I’ve found myself in a position where a lot of people needed my help, advice or they would just like to chat about something. It’s hard to say no to these things. I needed to learn to say no to things that I believed were not so important, critical, or even needed.  

我发现自己处于这样一种境地：很多人需要我的帮助、建议，或者他们只是想和我聊聊天。很难拒绝这些事情。我需要学会拒绝那些我认为不那么重要、不那么关键、甚至不那么需要的事情。

As much as it’s important to help as many people as possible, there needs to be a correct balance between meetings and your contribution.  

帮助尽可能多的人固然重要，但在会议和你的贡献之间也需要有一个正确的平衡。

What I learned is that the best way to do this is to dedicate particular blocks to your own focus time and the rest to managerial time.  

我的经验是，做到这一点的最好办法是，将特定的时间段留给自己专注的时间，其余时间留给管理者。

For example, you can block four hours, three days a week for your own focus time. And the rest is managerial time. I suggest to block as many hours as needed.  

例如，你可以每周三天，每天抽出四个小时作为自己的专注时间。其余时间为管理时间。我建议你根据需要来分配时间。

Try to find the right balance for yourself at that particular time.  

试着在特定时间找到适合自己的平衡点。

2.  **You can control what you can control  
    
    你可以控制你能控制的事情**
    

I often felt that there were many things that I would like to change, but I didn’t fully understand that I don’t make all the decisions across the business.  

我经常觉得有很多事情我想改变，但我并不完全明白，我并不能决定整个企业的所有决策。

I can control the changes or responsibilities of my team, but for teams outside of my area, I wasn’t able to make decisions for them.  

我可以控制我的团队的变化或责任，但对于我所在区域以外的团队，我无法为他们做决定。

What I learned is that the best thing you can do is to establish great relationships across the organization and try to provide feedback or suggestions to people who are responsible for a particular part of the business.  

我学到的是，你能做的最好的事情就是在整个组织中建立良好的关系，并尝试向负责特定业务部分的人提供反馈或建议。

3.  **Stay technical, but avoid going into too many details  
    
    保持技术性，但避免涉及过多细节**
    

I wanted to be too much in those fine details, as said above and this brought me close to burning out.  

正如上文所说，我想过多地关注这些细节，这让我几近焦头烂额。

I’ve learned that It’s important to stay technical, no matter if you have a lot of managerial responsibilities. To help the team the most, you need to understand as well as have strong opinions about particular technical decisions or directions.  

我认识到，无论你是否肩负很多管理职责，保持技术性都很重要。为了给团队提供最大帮助，你需要理解特定的技术决策或方向，并对其有强烈的意见。

But don’t go into too many details - rather delegate the details to the team. You need to be involved in important decisions that are crucial for the business, but delegate the small details which are not so important.  

但不要涉及太多细节，而是将细节交给团队。你需要参与对业务至关重要的重要决策，但也要把不太重要的小细节交给别人。

You can get overwhelmed by too much information very quickly if you have too many things on your mind.  

如果你脑子里想的事情太多，很快就会被太多的信息淹没。

I always like to say that investing in yourself and your knowledge is a great investment anytime. I like to read, network with others and go to events (conferences and meetups).  

我总是喜欢说，投资自己和自己的知识，无论何时都是一项伟大的投资。我喜欢阅读、与他人交流并参加各种活动（会议和聚会）。
