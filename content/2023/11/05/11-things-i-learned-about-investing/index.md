Hello everyone, 大家好

After reading a few excellent pieces on lessons about markets recently, here are 11 things I wish I had known much earlier (I’m sharing my favorite readings at the end).  

最近读了几篇关于市场经验教训的优秀文章后，我希望自己能更早地了解以下 11 件事（我将在最后分享我最喜欢的读后感）。

**Your** **first job is to know yourself.** You have to understand your temperament and your relationship to money. Wrong about your temperament? Watch the market flush you out. Never contemplated your _emotional_ relationship to money? Careful, you might self sabotage.  

你的首要任务是了解自己。你必须了解自己的性情以及自己与金钱的关系。你的性情有误？看着市场把你冲走吧。从未思考过自己与金钱的情感关系？小心，你可能会自我破坏。

> A series of market decisions does add up, believe it or not, to a kind of personality portrait. It is, in one small way, a method of finding out who you are, but it can be very expensive. This is the first Irregular Rule: **If you don’t know who you are, this is an expensive place to find out.** — [Adam Smith (George Goodman),](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/investment-library-the-money-game) _[The Money Game](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/investment-library-the-money-game)_  
> 
> 不管你信不信，一系列的市场决策加在一起，确实是一种个性画像。从一个微小的方面来说，这是一种找出你是谁的方法，但它可能非常昂贵。这就是第一条 "不规则规则"：如果你不知道自己是谁，那么要想知道自己是谁，这里就是一个昂贵的地方。- 亚当-斯密（乔治-古德曼），《金钱游戏

Knowing yourself deeply, and following your unique path, acts as protection against the herd instinct, envy, FOMO, and the deafening drumbeat of public opinion.  

深入了解自己，走自己独特的道路，可以抵御从众本能、嫉妒、FOMO 和震耳欲聋的舆论鼓噪。

The same goes for investigating your motivation.  

调查自己的动机也是如此。

> Whatever you want to do in life, you don't solve for money, you don't solve for prestige or adulation or anything like that. —_[Todd Combs](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/weekend-journal-smoking-for-the-mind)_  
> 
> 无论你想在生活中做什么，你都不能为金钱、声望或赞美之类的东西而烦恼。- 托德-康姆斯

**The best investors are obsessed with playing the game.** They don’t do it _only_ for the money. “The irony is that this is a money game,” [Goodman once observed](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/investment-library-the-money-game), “and money is the way we keep score.” And yet, “the real object of the Game is not money. It is the playing of the Game itself.”  

最好的投资者痴迷于玩游戏。他们并不只是为了钱。"具有讽刺意味的是，这是一场金钱游戏，"古德曼曾指出，"金钱是我们记分的方式。然而，"游戏的真正目的不是金钱。而是游戏本身"。

The best are completely immersed and obsessed with winning. They really can’t help themselves. Many never truly retire from the markets. They are often obsessed with other games as well:  

高手们完全沉浸其中，痴迷于胜利。他们真的无法控制自己。许多人从未真正退出市场。他们往往还沉迷于其他游戏：

> Ever since I was a kid, I liked playing games, whether it is chess, bridge, backgammon, poker, or sports. I don’t know a single great trader who doesn’t share the same trait. If doing this was about the money, I would have quit a long time ago. — _Paul Tudor Jones_  
> 
> 我从小就喜欢玩游戏，无论是国际象棋、桥牌、五子棋、扑克还是体育运动。我不知道有哪位伟大的交易员不具备同样的特质。如果只是为了赚钱，我早就不干了。

It’s essential that you figure out your motivation. Is it _intrinsic_ or have you become enchanted by the _outcomes_ you’ve observed? When Stanley Druckenmiller was asked about what he looked for in money managers, he responded with “number one, passion.”  

你必须弄清自己的动机。它是内在的，还是你被自己观察到的结果迷住了？当斯坦利-德鲁肯米勒（Stanley Druckenmiller）被问及他寻找理财经理的标准时，他的回答是 "第一，激情"。

> This business is so invigorating to certain individuals, they’re going to work 24/7, and you’re competing against them. **If you’re with people doing it for the money, you’re going to get run over.** — _Stanley Druckenmiller_  
> 
> 这个行业对某些人来说是如此振奋人心，他们会全天候工作，而你要与他们竞争。如果你和那些为了钱而工作的人在一起，你就会被碾压。- 斯坦利-德鲁肯米勒

Remember: these are the kinds of people you compete with.  

记住：你的竞争对手就是这种人。

I don’t think you can choose to be like this. For better or worse, you’re either hooked or not.  

我认为你无法选择成为这样的人。无论好坏，你要么上瘾，要么不上瘾。

What if you’re not as passionate? Accept who you are and investigate what you are passionate about. Allow yourself to be curious. As it relates to investing, find a strategy that doesn’t require the same intensity. Ben Graham pioneered the practice of security analysis and yet he, a deeply curious intellectual, [pursued a deep value strategy that allowed him plenty of time for his other pursuits](https://neckar.substack.com/p/enough-the-forgotten-lesson-of-ben). Buffett, his most famous student, on the other hand was laser focused on being the best. Buffett was willing to invest _a lot_ more time and effort to compete. Speaking of Buffett…  

如果你没有那么多热情呢？接受自己，研究自己对什么充满热情。让自己充满好奇心。在投资方面，找到一种不需要同样强度的策略。本-格雷厄姆（Ben Graham）是证券分析实践的先驱，但他作为一个好奇心极强的知识分子，却奉行深度价值投资策略，这让他有足够的时间去追求其他方面。而他最著名的学生巴菲特则专注于成为最优秀的人。巴菲特愿意投入更多的时间和精力去竞争。说到巴菲特

**You are not the next Warren Buffett.** Or the next George Soros, Peter Lynch, David Tepper, etc. … There is nothing wrong with picturing yourself in someone else’s shoes early on. And it is important to understand how and why some investors excelled. But you have to integrate those lessons into a path that is uniquely yours, in markets and life.  

你不是下一个巴菲特。或者下一个乔治-索罗斯、彼得-林奇、大卫-泰珀等。......一开始就站在别人的立场上想象自己并没有错。而且，了解一些投资者如何以及为何出类拔萃也很重要。但是，你必须将这些经验教训融入到市场和生活中，走出一条属于自己的独特道路。

Michael Lewis once noted that the more Michael Burry studied Buffett, “the less he thought Buffett could be copied.”  

迈克尔-刘易斯曾经指出，迈克尔-伯里越是研究巴菲特，"他就越不认为巴菲特可以复制"。

> Buffett, though he had every advantage in learning from Ben Graham, did not copy Ben Graham, but rather set out on his own path, and ran money his way, by his own rules. **To succeed in a spectacular fashion you had to be spectacularly unusual.** — _The Big Short_  
> 
> 巴菲特虽然拥有向本-格雷厄姆学习的一切优势，但他并没有照搬本-格雷厄姆，而是踏上了自己的道路，用自己的方式、自己的规则来赚钱。要想以惊人的方式取得成功，就必须有惊人的不同寻常之处。- 大空头

Get inspired by the previous generations, but don’t blindly copy.  

从前辈身上汲取灵感，但不要盲目照搬。

Midjourney 旅途中

The sweet spot is to find a strategy that works, which suits your temperament, and which _interests_ you because…  

最重要的是找到一个有效的、适合你的性格、让你感兴趣的策略，因为......

**Good investing is mostly ‘boring’ working with brief moments of excitement.** I say ‘boring’ because the research process is boring to most people, but not to everyone. It is an endless loop of keeping up with the world and trying to understand things — a company, an industry, a trend, a technology, an event — by reading, crunching data, and talking to people. Every once in a while, things get exciting. Like when you find a great idea or when the market punches you in the face. And in exactly those moments, you have to resist and remain calm. It’s the inverse of how most people go through life: they run from the grind of mundane work and throw themselves into thrills.  

好的投资大多是 "枯燥 "的，只有短暂的兴奋。我之所以说 "枯燥"，是因为对大多数人来说，研究过程是枯燥的，但并非对每个人都是如此。它是一个无休止的循环，通过阅读、计算数据和与人交谈，了解世界并试图理解事物--一家公司、一个行业、一种趋势、一种技术、一个事件。偶尔，事情也会变得令人兴奋。比如你发现了一个好点子，或者市场给了你一记重拳。而恰恰在这些时候，你必须忍住，保持冷静。这与大多数人的生活方式恰恰相反：他们逃避平淡无奇的工作，把自己投入到刺激中去。

If the process of learning about companies and markets feels like keeping up with your favorite sport or celebrities, you’re ahead of the game.  

如果在了解公司和市场的过程中，感觉就像在关注自己喜欢的运动或名人，那么你就走在了游戏的前面。

This is why there are no ‘realistic’ movies or shows about investing. You either focus on people (the drama of fraud, deals, internal politics) or rare pockets of fireworks (a crisis, a big idea, or both like the _Big Short’_).  

这就是为什么没有关于投资的 "写实 "电影或节目。你要么关注人（欺诈、交易、内部政治的戏剧性），要么关注罕见的烟花（危机、大创意，或两者兼而有之，如《大空头》）。

Another reason for [the lack of compelling storytelling is the institutionalization of finance](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/does-wall-street-need-new-storytelling). This is why **you must** **understand the difference between investing and the** _**business**_ **of investing.** [One is a craft, the other a career](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/attempting-the-impossible). The investor wants to make great investments. The _professional_ investor gets paid to deliver a service for a client. A lot of people fall in love with the former but end up working as the latter.  

缺乏引人入胜的故事的另一个原因是金融的制度化。这就是为什么你必须了解投资与投资业务之间的区别。一个是手艺，一个是职业。投资者希望做出伟大的投资。职业投资者则是为客户提供服务，从中获取报酬。很多人爱上了前者，却最终成为了后者。

Finding an edge in investing means gaining an advantage on the market. An edge in the _business_ of investing can be hiring the right talent, investing in better technology, building a brand, maintaining the right culture, or cultivating important relationships. Paradoxically, the people who are very good at the business of investing can end up with more money (due to greater scale) and also [create opportunities](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/what-creates-opportunity) for other investors due to the constraints and incentives of their organizations.  

在投资中找到优势意味着在市场中获得优势。投资业务中的优势可以是聘用合适的人才、投资更好的技术、打造品牌、维护正确的文化或培养重要的关系。矛盾的是，擅长投资业务的人最终会获得更多资金（由于规模更大），同时也会由于其组织的约束和激励机制而为其他投资者创造机会。

**Investing forces you to wrestle with paradoxes.** There are many ways to succeed, often in contradictory ways. Take, for example, the market. What is the market? A [complex adaptive system](http://www.e-m-h.org/Maub02.pdf). But what is your _relationship to_ the market?  

投资迫使你与悖论搏斗。成功的方式有很多种，而且往往是相互矛盾的。以市场为例。市场是什么？一个复杂的适应系统。但你与市场的关系是什么？

This is where people face a fork in the road. Do you see the market as the manic-depressive cartoon of ‘Mr. Market’, an emotional source of opportunity? Or is it a force of nature and source of invaluable information?  

这就是人们面临的岔路口。你是把市场看成是 "市场先生 "的狂躁抑郁漫画，是机会的情感来源？还是将其视为一种自然力量和宝贵信息的来源？

“The market is there to serve you,” Buffett says, referencing Ben Graham, “and not to instruct you. That’s of enormous importance.”  

"巴菲特提到本-格雷厄姆（Ben Graham）时说："市场是为你服务的，而不是指导你的。这一点非常重要。

> When people talk about momentum in stocks or charting or any kind of things like that, they’re saying that the market is instructing you. **The market doesn’t instruct us; the market is there to serve us.** If it does something silly, we get a chance to do something. But **it doesn’t tell us anything. It just tells us prices.** — _Warren Buffett_  
> 
> 当人们谈论股票动量或图表或任何类似的东西时，他们是在说市场在指导你。市场并没有指导我们，市场是为我们服务的。如果它做了傻事，我们就有机会做点什么。但它不会告诉我们任何事情。它只是告诉我们价格。- 沃伦-巴菲特

Buffett does his own work and if the market is out of line, he acts. When it is not, “you forget it and go play bridge that day and the next day see whether there’s something new.” But that is just _one way_ of relating to the market.  

巴菲特自己做自己的事，如果市场出现异常，他就采取行动。如果没有，"你就忘了它，当天去打桥牌，第二天再看看是否有新的东西"。但这只是与市场打交道的一种方式。

Traders may take the opposite approach: the market is composed of people, including people who know more than the trader. There is signal to be found in the noise of the crowd. According to [Bruce Kovner](https://www.brucekovner.com/Caxton20thAnniversary.html), “close observation of price behavior is always necessary for the discipline of successful trading.”  

交易者可能会采取相反的方法：市场是由人组成的，包括比交易者懂得更多的人。在人群的嘈杂声中可以发现信号。布鲁斯-科夫纳认为，"密切观察价格行为始终是成功交易的必要纪律"。

> If we can understand what the market is telling us, we will most likely be able to understand how to trade it. **Listen to the market, hear it, don’t tell it what to do. Listen.** — _Bruce Kovner_  
> 
> 如果我们能够理解市场在告诉我们什么，我们就很可能能够理解如何交易。倾听市场的声音，听它说，不要告诉它该怎么做。听- 布鲁斯-科夫纳

“A big part of my process,” Stanley Druckenmiller once explained, “is taking signals from markets.”  

"斯坦利-德鲁肯米勒曾解释说，"我的工作流程中很重要的一部分，就是接受市场的信号"。

> I’ve always believed markets are smarter than I am. They send out a message and if I listen to them properly, no matter how powerful my thesis, if they’re screaming something else, it’s telling me you’ve got to re-evaluate. — _Stanley Druckenmiller_  
> 
> 我一直相信市场比我聪明。它们会发出信息，如果我认真倾听，无论我的论断多么有力，如果它们在喊别的什么，那就是在告诉我，你必须重新评估。- 斯坦利-德鲁肯米勒

Is the market a servant or a source of valuable information? Both sides can be right in the context of their strategies. It’s important to be clear and explicit about the market’s role in your process.  

市场是仆人还是有价值信息的来源？在各自的战略背景下，双方都可能是正确的。重要的是，要清楚、明确地认识到市场在你的投资过程中所扮演的角色。

Which leads us to another seeming contradiction: **you can learn from any great investor, but often not what you expect.** All of them can teach you about human nature, about markets, about resilience, about mistakes, and about the lonely search for opportunity. Study what worked for others, even if you never intend to pursue their strategy. What did they figure out about the world? How would they think about your strategy? What can you learn from the contrast? Remember that all of them wrestled with the same market and the same inner game.  

这就引出了另一个看似矛盾的问题：你可以从任何伟大的投资者身上学到东西，但往往不是你所期望的。他们都能教你人性、市场、应变能力、错误以及孤独地寻找机会。研究别人的成功经验，即使你从未打算采用他们的策略。他们是如何认识这个世界的？他们会如何看待你的战略？你能从对比中学到什么？记住，他们都在与同样的市场和同样的内心博弈搏斗。

If you are interested in learning specific strategies, you need to consider context: how does their success fit into the context of time, opportunity set, and their character? Parse their stories for what is being left unsaid ([remember that the winners re-write history](https://neckar.substack.com/p/how-fortunes-are-made-revisiting)). Consider the whole arc of their lives. The most valuable lessons are rarely the obvious ones.  

如果你有兴趣学习具体的战略，就需要考虑背景：他们的成功是如何与时间、机遇和他们的性格相匹配的？分析他们的故事，寻找未被提及的内容（记住，成功者会改写历史）。考虑他们的整个人生轨迹。最有价值的经验很少是显而易见的。

> Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless, and add what is specifically your own. — _Bruce Lee_  
> 
> 吸收有用的东西，摒弃无用的东西，加入自己特有的东西。- 李小龙

It’s a delicate dance between observing what works and not overfitting to what worked _this cycle_.  

这是一种微妙的舞蹈，既要观察什么是有效的，又要避免过度适应本周期有效的东西。

For example, **the world has a lot more tails than I imagined.** On the one hand, it now seems rational to me to allocate some capital to open-ended and potentially asymmetric bets. On the other hand, _chasing_ tails can decimate your portfolio with worthless options. Or entice you to ride a boom-bust cycle all the way up and back down again.  

例如，这个世界的尾巴比我想象的要多得多。一方面，在我看来，现在将一些资金分配给开放式和潜在的不对称赌注是合理的。另一方面，追逐尾部可能会用毫无价值的期权毁掉你的投资组合。或者诱使你在繁荣与萧条的循环中一路上涨，然后再次下跌。

Long-term investment success looks pretty boring. “The unifying thing I see across the money managers that I know who have 20 plus year records that are good,” my friend [Dan McMurtrie once said](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1603397098954801161), “is they are never sexy at any moment in time.” At bond manager PIMCO this was called ‘[strategic mediocrity](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/03/1102841155/former-bond-manager-shares-investing-strategy-that-he-calls-strategic-mediocrity).’  

长期投资的成功看起来非常乏味。"我的朋友丹-麦克默特里（Dan McMurtrie）曾经说过："在我所认识的那些拥有 20 多年良好记录的基金经理身上，我看到了一个共同点，那就是他们在任何时候都不性感。在债券经理人 PIMCO，这被称为'战略平庸'。

Be open to tail outcomes, but don’t bet your career on pursuing extremes. Outliers like Amazon or Bitcoin happen, but rarely.  

对尾部结果持开放态度，但不要把你的职业生涯赌在追求极端上。像亚马逊或比特币这样的异常值会出现，但很少。

> Jeff Bezos to Buffett: “Your investment thesis is so simple. You’re the second richest guy in the world, and it’s so simple. Why doesn’t everyone just copy you?”  
> 
> 杰夫-贝索斯对巴菲特说："你的投资理念太简单了。你是世界上第二富有的人，而它又如此简单。为什么大家都不模仿你呢？"
> 
> Warren Buffett: “Because nobody wants to get rich slowly.”  
> 
> 沃伦-巴菲特："因为没人想慢慢致富。"

**The market will punish you for being in a rush.** Well, technically you will punish yourself.  

市场会惩罚你的匆忙。严格来说，你会惩罚自己。

I get it. You want to be rich and enjoy life while you’re still young. It’s just that the market _does not care_ about what you want. It will occasionally offer amazing opportunities, what Soros called a ‘special day’, but it does so on its own schedule. Swinging for the fences when you need money is a sure way to lose your capital.  

我明白了。你想致富，想趁年轻享受生活。只是，市场并不关心你想要什么。它偶尔会提供惊人的机会，也就是索罗斯所说的 "特殊的一天"，但它会按照自己的时间表行事。在你需要钱的时候挥金如土，肯定会让你血本无归。

> [Byron Wien (RIP) recounting a conversation with George Soros](https://twitter.com/NeckarValue/status/1717915284533629069): “He once said something to me that was very useful: 'The trouble with you, Byron, is that y**ou go to work every day and you think that because you go to work every day you should do something**.  
> 
> 拜伦-维恩（Byron Wien，RIP）在回忆与乔治-索罗斯的一次谈话时说："他曾对我说过一句非常有用的话：'拜伦，你的问题在于你每天都去上班，你认为因为你每天都去上班，所以你应该做些什么。
> 
> I don’t go to work every day. I only go to work on the days that make sense to go to work. ... And I really do something on that day. **But** **you go to work and you do something every day and you don’t realize when it’s** **a special day.**”’  
> 
> 我并不是每天都去上班。我只在有意义的日子去上班。...我真的在那一天做了些事情。但你每天都去工作，每天都做一些事情，你就不会意识到这是一个特殊的日子"。

Investing is a game that requires a lot of patience. There are other areas in which the energy of urgency can be a huge advantage. Again: your first job is to know yourself and understand what best suits your unique character and interests.  

投资是一场需要极大耐心的游戏。在其他领域，"紧迫感 "也能带来巨大优势。还是那句话：你的首要任务是了解自己，了解什么最适合你的独特性格和兴趣。

**Investing is a marathon and your most important job is to survive.** Great long-term track records are rare. [Even great investors who love the game burn out](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/dan-mcmurtrie-resilience-recovery?s=w#details). Peter Lynch couldn’t find time for his family and quit. Soros once compared his fund to a parasite that was consuming him. People sprint and overtrade, take too much risk, never leave the office, burn out, ruin their health, wreck their relationships. They get lost in [The Maze](https://neckar.substack.com/p/the-maze).  

投资是一场马拉松，你最重要的工作是生存下来。伟大的长期业绩记录并不多见。即使是热爱投资的伟大投资者也会倦怠。彼得-林奇（Peter Lynch）因为没有时间照顾家庭而辞职。索罗斯曾把他的基金比作吞噬他的寄生虫。人们冲刺，过度交易，承担过多风险，从不离开办公室，倦怠，毁掉健康，破坏人际关系。他们迷失在迷宫中。

There will always be more to do in markets _unless_ you take yourself out of the game. To get wealthy, you have to protect your capital, your mind, and your health. **You have to develop the confidence that you will always find another opportunity.**  

市场上永远有更多的事情要做，除非你把自己置身于游戏之外。要想致富，你必须保护自己的资本、头脑和健康。你必须树立信心，相信自己总会找到另一个机会。

> Druckenmiller about his mentor Soros: “Soros is the best loss taker I’ve ever seen. He doesn’t care whether he wins or loses on a trade. **If a trade doesn’t work, he’s confident enough about his ability to win on other trades that he can easily walk away** from the position. There are a lot of shoes on the shelf; wear only the ones that fit. If you’re extremely confident, taking a loss doesn’t bother you.”  
> 
> 德鲁肯米勒谈到他的导师索罗斯时说："索罗斯是我见过的最好的亏损者。他不在乎自己在交易中是赢还是输。如果一笔交易不成功，他对自己在其他交易中获胜的能力有足够的信心，他可以轻松地放弃头寸。架子上有很多鞋子，只穿合脚的。如果你非常自信，吃亏并不会困扰你"。

**Finally, you don’t become a great investor by reading about other great investors.** Don’t let learning turn into procrastination. If you want to become a better investor, invest. Remember what Charlie Munger said about the young man asking advice from Mozart:  

最后，你不可能通过阅读其他优秀投资者的故事成为一名优秀的投资者。不要让学习变成拖延。如果你想成为更好的投资者，那就投资吧。记住查理-芒格（Charlie Munger）在谈到年轻人向莫扎特请教时所说的话：

> A young man of 25 or so once asked to see Mozart and he said, “I’m thinking of starting to write symphonies, and I’d like to get your advice.”  
> 
> 有个25岁左右的年轻人想见莫扎特 他说 "我想开始写交响曲" "我想听听你的建议"
> 
> And Mozart said, “Well, you’re too young to write symphonies.”  
> 
> 莫扎特说："你太年轻了，写不了交响乐"
> 
> And the guy says, “But you were writing them when you were ten-years-old.”  
> 
> 那人说："但你10岁时就开始写了"
> 
> And Mozart says, “Yes, but I wasn’t asking anybody else for advice on how to do it.”  
> 
> 莫扎特说："是的，但我没有向别人请教"
