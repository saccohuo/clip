One of my favorite scenes in _The Matrix_ is when Tank the operator hooks up Neo to a brain-computer interface and starts uploading all kinds of skills directly into his mind. In seconds, Neo becomes a kung fu master.  
在《黑客帝国》中，我最喜欢的场景之一是操作员坦克将尼奥连接到一个脑机接口上，并开始将各种技能直接上传到他的大脑中。几秒钟后，尼奥就变成了功夫大师。

![I know kung fu](https://s3.amazonaws.com/readwiseio/2019/07/i-know-kung-fu.gif)

I've always imagined nonfiction books to be kind of like those hand-labeled "skill cartridges" scattered about the Nebuchadnezzar. After all, writing such a book is the act of compressing months if not years of accumulated knowledge, wisdom, and expertise into a cohesive text that can be consumed in mere hours.  
我一直认为，非虚构类图书就像散落在尼布甲尼撒河上的那些贴有手工标签的 "技能墨盒"。毕竟，写这样一本书是将数月甚至数年积累的知识、智慧和专业技能压缩成一个有凝聚力的文本，只需几个小时就能读完。

The only problem with this comparison is that, unlike Neo in _The Matrix_, we quickly forget nearly everything we read. How many times have you read a book in pursuit of bettering some area of your life, imagining with anticipation the whole time how your future self would take advantage, and then, once you finished, promptly did nothing?  
这种比较的唯一问题是，与《黑客帝国》中的尼奥不同，我们很快就会忘记读过的几乎所有内容。有多少次，您为了改善生活中的某些方面而阅读一本书，并一直满怀期待地想象着未来的自己将如何利用这本书，但当您读完之后，却什么也没做。

For example, many of us invested over ten hours into reading that book about how to schedule blocks of focus time, avoid distractions, and get into a deep flow state. Yet we still multitask, our iPhones aren't on grayscale, and our Google Calendars looks like an aborted game of Tetris.  
例如，我们中的许多人花了十几个小时来阅读那本关于如何安排集中时间、避免分心和进入深度流动状态的书。然而，我们仍然在进行多任务处理，我们的iPhone不是灰度的，我们的谷歌日历看起来像一个失败的俄罗斯方块游戏。

Why does this happen? It's because what we read flows through us like sand through open fingers. So much human potential is stored in nonfiction books, but so little is realized due to mere forgetfulness.  
为什么会出现这种情况？这是因为我们读过的东西就像沙子一样从指缝间流过。在非虚构类书籍中蕴藏着人类巨大的潜能，但由于遗忘，这些潜能的实现却少之又少。

This is the problem we're trying to solve with Readwise and we're one step closer thanks to a new feature called _Mastery_.  
这正是我们试图通过Readwise解决的问题，得益于一项名为 "Mastery "的新功能，我们又向前迈进了一步。

Mastery is our term for the one-two punch of active recall and spaced repetition applied to the notes and highlights you take while reading. Used together, these principles of cognitive science enable you to retain substantially more of what you read with significantly less effort.<sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive-translate-mark="1" data-immersive-translate-paragraph-id="16"><a href="https://blog.readwise.io/hack-your-brain-with-spaced-repetition-and-active-recall/#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>  
掌握 "是我们对主动回忆和间隔重复的双管齐下的称谓，适用于您在阅读时所作的笔记和重点内容。将这些认知科学原理结合在一起使用，您就能以更少的努力保留更多的阅读内容。

The rest of this article will show you how to start using Mastery to hack your brain like Neo in _The Matrix_.  
本文的其余部分将向您展示如何像《黑客帝国》中的尼奥一样，开始使用 "精通 "来入侵您的大脑。

## What is active recall? 什么是主动召回？

[Active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall) (also known as quizzing, testing, or retrieval) is the process by which we challenge our minds to retrieve a piece of information rather than passively reviewing or re-reading the same.  
主动回忆（也称为测验、测试或检索）是我们挑战自己的大脑以检索信息的过程，而不是被动地复习或重读信息。

For example, let's say we're interested in the science of learning, so we want to commit the following fact from _Make It Stick_ to memory:  
例如，假设我们对学习科学很感兴趣，那么我们希望将《让学习更有效》一书中的以下事实牢记于心：

> In very short order we lose something like 70 percent of what we've just heard or read. After that, forgetting begins to slow, and the last 30 percent or so falls away more slowly, but the lesson is clear: a central challenge to improving the way we learn is finding a way to interrupt the process of forgetting.  
> 在很短的时间内，我们就会遗忘70%的刚听过或读过的内容。在此之后，遗忘的速度开始减慢，最后30%左右的遗忘速度会更慢，但教训是显而易见的：改进我们学习方式的核心挑战是找到一种方法来打断遗忘的过程。

The passive approach to remembering this information would be to simply re-read that passage from time to time. This is no doubt better than never revisiting the passage at all, but research has repeatedly shown that active recall testing is significantly more effective.  
被动的记忆方法是不时地重读该段文字。这无疑比完全不重读该段落要好，但研究一再表明，主动记忆测试要有效得多。

How could we transform this into active recall? One approach would be to convert the passage into a question and quiz yourself on the answer:  
我们如何将其转化为主动记忆？一种方法是将段落转换成问题，然后问自己答案：

> Question: According to Make It Stick, approximately how much of what we've just heard or read do we lose in very short order?  
> 问题根据Make It Stick一书，我们刚刚听到或读到的内容大约有多少会在短时间内丢失？

\[commence active recall...\] \[开始主动召回...\]

> Answer: 70%. 答案：70%：70%.

The power of this technique probably requires no further justification, but the scientific evidence backs it up. The key to learning more is forgetting less. The key to forgetting less is systematic _review_. And the best way to review is through active recall.  
这种技巧的威力可能无需进一步说明，但科学证据却证明了这一点。多学的关键是少忘。减少遗忘的关键在于系统复习。而复习的最佳方式就是主动回忆。

## How does Readwise harness active recall?  
Readwise如何实现主动召回？

Readwise enables you to easily convert your highlights into two forms of active recall: question & answer and cloze deletion.  
Readwise使您能够轻松地将您的重点内容转换成两种形式的主动记忆：问答和掐头去尾。

The rephrasing of the _Make It Stick_ quote above is often referred to as _question & answer_, or simply Q&A. While Q&A is the pinnacle of active recall, and therefore we can't not support it as part of the Mastery feature, it is somewhat effortful to create those question & answer pairs. Accordingly, you'll probably reserve Q&A for only the choicest highlights and the most impactful books.  
上述 "Make It Stick "引文的重述通常被称为问答，或简称Q&A。虽然问答是主动记忆的最高境界，因此我们不能不将其作为 "掌握 "功能的一部分加以支持，但创建这些问答对子却有些费力。因此，您可能会将问答保留给最精选的重点内容和最有影响力的书籍。

![difference between knohow and knowledge](https://s3.amazonaws.com/readwiseio/2019/09/q-a-mastery-card.gif)

As a more everyday alternative, you can also employ a deceptively simple technique known as [cloze deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test). With cloze deletion, a salient keyword or keyphrase is hidden from the passage, giving you an opportunity to pause and consider the missing word. For example:  
作为一种更日常的替代方法，您还可以使用一种被称为 "掐头去尾"（cloze deletion）的简单技巧。通过 "掐头去尾"，在文章中隐藏一个突出的关键词或关键短语，让您有机会停顿一下并思考所缺少的单词。例如

> In very short order we lose something like \[...\] of what we've just heard or read. After that, forgetting begins to slow, and the last 30 percent or so falls away more slowly, but the lesson is clear: a central challenge to improving the way we learn is finding a way to interrupt the process of forgetting.  
> 在很短的时间内，我们就会遗忘\[......\]刚刚听过或读过的内容。在此之后，遗忘的速度开始减慢，最后30%左右的遗忘速度会更慢，但教训是显而易见的：改进我们的学习方式的核心挑战是找到一种方法来打断遗忘的过程。

\[commence active recall...\] \[开始主动召回...\]

> Answer: 70%. 答案：70%：70%.

Cloze deletion is, of course, just a fancy way of saying fill-in-the-blank. This might seem a trivial tweak, but the simple act of hiding a word forces you to consider the surrounding context and search your mind for an answer. The hidden word itself isn't that important; it's the modest effort of being forced to think about what you'd otherwise passively read.  
当然，Cloze deletion只是 "填空 "的一种花哨的说法。这似乎是一个微不足道的调整，但隐藏一个单词的简单行为迫使您考虑周围的上下文，并在脑海中搜索答案。隐藏的单词本身并不重要，重要的是迫使您思考原本被动阅读的内容。

For example, from another study cited in _Make It Stick_:  
例如，Make It Stick一书中引用了另一项研究：

> ... researchers showed that simply asking a subject to fill in a word's missing letters resulted in better memory of the word. Consider a list of word pairs. For a pair like foot-shoe, those who studied the pair intact had lower subsequent recall than those who studied the pair from a clue as obvious as foot-s\_\_e. ... The modest effort required to generate the cued answer while studying the pairs strengthened memory of the target word tested later (shoe)."  
> ......研究人员发现，只需让受试者填写单词中缺少的字母，就能加深对该单词的记忆。考虑一下单词对列表。对于 "foot-shoe "这样的单词对，那些完整地学习过该单词对的人比那些从 "foot-s\_\_e "这样明显的线索中学习过该单词对的人的后续记忆力要低。.........在学习词对时产生提示答案所需的适度努力加强了对后来测试的目标词（鞋）的记忆"。

That's active recall: the first leg of Mastery. Spaced repetition is the second.  
这就是主动回忆：掌握的第一步。间隔重复是第二步。

## What is spaced repetition? 什么是间隔重复？

[Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is a technique for _spacing_ out of reviews of previously learned material according to an algorithm designed to optimize your limited time for review. Each time you review a piece of information, you supply feedback to that algorithm which estimates the optimal time to show you that information again.  
间隔重复是一种根据算法间隔复习以前所学材料的技术，旨在优化您有限的复习时间。每复习一次，您就向算法提供一次反馈，算法会估算出再次向您展示该信息的最佳时间。

Without getting too technical, if you deeply understand something, you don't need to be reminded of it that often whereas if you struggle with something, you need to be reminded of it more often. Further, each time you successfully recall something, your memory of that thing is strengthened, so the intervals between successive reviews become longer and longer.  
在不涉及太多技术问题的情况下，如果您深刻理解某件事情，您就不需要经常提醒您，而如果您对某件事情感到吃力，您就需要经常提醒您。此外，每当您成功回忆起某件事情时，您对该事物的记忆就会得到加强，因此连续回顾的间隔时间就会越来越长。

Spaced repetition is the literal opposite of cramming which, we probably don't have to tell you, is a great way of passing a test but a terrible way of truly learning something.  
间隔重复与填鸭式学习截然相反，填鸭式学习可能不用我们多说，是通过考试的好方法，但却是真正学习知识的糟糕方法。

## How does Readwise harness spaced repetition?  
Readwise如何处理间隔重复？

From the very beginning, Readwise has leveraged the principle of spaced repetition to space out reviews of your highlights. But now, with Mastery, Readwise enables you to supply precise feedback ensuring you see better-than-average passages more often, less-than-average passages less often, and so on.  
从一开始，Readwise就利用间隔重复的原则来间隔复习您的重点内容。但是现在，通过Mastery，Readwise能够为您提供精确的反馈，确保您更经常地看到比平均水平好的段落，比平均水平差的段落，等等。

## Using Mastery in Readwise 在Readwise中使用Mastery

Getting started with Mastery is easy.  
开始使用Mastery非常简单。

Whenever you come across a highlight you want to master, hit the Master button (or keyboard shortuct: `m`), choose either cloze deletion or Q&A, and convert the previously passive passage to active recall.  
每当您遇到想要掌握的重点内容时，点击 "掌握 "按钮（或键盘快捷键： `m` ），选择 "掐头去尾 "或 "问答"，将之前的被动段落转换为主动回忆。

![cloze deletion in Readwise](https://s3.amazonaws.com/readwiseio/2019/09/cloze-deletion.gif)

You'll then be prompted with the spaced repetition buttons. If you want to see the highlight soon — because it's particularly insightful, relevant to your life right now, or hard to remember — choose `Soon`. If you want to see the highlight again but there's no immediate urgency, choose `Eventually`.  
然后您会看到间隔重复按钮。如果您想尽快看到该重点内容--因为它特别有见地、与您现在的生活息息相关，或者很难记住--请选择 `Soon` 。如果您想再看一遍，但没有紧迫感，请选择 `Eventually` 。

You'll see this Mastery card again in your Daily Readwise in approximately one to four weeks (depending on the spaced repetition feedback you supplied and the precedence of your other Mastery cards).  
大约一至四周后，您将在每日阅读中再次看到这张掌握卡（取决于您提供的间隔重复反馈以及其他掌握卡的优先级）。

![reveal active recall phrase](https://s3.amazonaws.com/readwiseio/2019/09/reveal-keyphrase.gif)

Going forward, your Daily Readwise will be divided into two halves. The first half will contain _unprocessed_ highlights which have never been reviewed before in Readwise or haven't been converted to Mastery cards. These highlights are resurfaced stochastically (i.e., at random).  
今后，您的 "每日阅读 "将分为两部分。前半部分包含未经处理的精彩内容，这些精彩内容之前从未在Readwise中回顾过，或尚未转换为精通卡。这些重点内容将随机出现（即随机出现）。

Note that you can manually "tune" the probability weights for each book and article through your [Preferences](https://readwise.io/preferences/tunebooks) page, dialing in the random algorithm described above. If you have a significant number of highlights, this is highly recommended. Tuning is like setting up a custom algorithmic feed for your own material which can be tweaked over and over as your interests change.  
请注意，您可以通过 "首选项 "页面手动 "调整 "每本书和每篇文章的概率权重，拨入上述随机算法。如果您有大量的重点内容，强烈建议您这样做。调整就像为您自己的资料设置一个自定义算法馈送，可以随着您兴趣的变化而反复调整。

![tuning your books](https://s3.amazonaws.com/readwiseio/2019/08/tuning.gif)

The second half of your Daily Readwise will contain your Mastery cards. These are resurfaced according to a spaced repetition algorithm and presented in active recall form. As with the initial creation of the Mastery card, once you're finished each review, you provide spaced repetition feedback informing how soon and how often you'd like to see that card in the future.<sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive-translate-mark="1" data-immersive-translate-paragraph-id="52"><a href="https://blog.readwise.io/hack-your-brain-with-spaced-repetition-and-active-recall/#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>  
每日阅读 "的后半部分将包含您的 "掌握卡"。这些卡片将根据间隔重复算法重新出现，并以主动回忆的形式呈现。与最初创建 "精通 "卡一样，当您完成每次复习后，您将提供间隔重复反馈，告知您希望在未来多久以及多长时间内看到该卡。

In addition to converting your highlights to Mastery cards during the Daily Readwise, you can also do so on a book-by-book or article-by-article basis. Reviewing all the highlights from a single book in chronological order, shortly after having finished it, is a particularly powerful method to integrate that book's takeaways into your life. We'll be adding to this functionality over time.  
除了在 "每日慧读 "中将精彩片段转化为 "精通 "卡片外，您还可以逐书或逐篇进行转化。在读完一本书后，按时间顺序回顾这本书的所有重点，是将这本书的收获融入生活的一种特别有效的方法。我们将逐步增加这一功能。

## Retention is NOT memorization 记忆不是死记硬背

One final word of caution: 最后提醒您一句：

The first time most people see Mastery in Readwise, they tend to assume it's about _memorization_. Sometimes they even assume it's about (gasp) _rote_ memorization.  
大多数人第一次在Readwise中看到Mastery时，往往会认为它是关于背诵的。有时，他们甚至会认为这就是死记硬背。

That's perfectly understandable. Mastery looks like flashcards and, unless you're one of the select few who keeps a [commonplace book](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/) like Ryan Holiday or a [Zettelkasten slip-box](https://takesmartnotes.com/) like Niklas Luhmann, your last exposure to flashcards was probably memorizing vocab words to score well on the SATs.  
这是完全可以理解的。除非您是像Ryan Holiday一样保留着一本普通的书，或者像Niklas Luhmann一样保留着一个Zettelkasten滑动盒的少数人之一，您最后一次接触闪存卡可能是为了在SAT考试中取得好成绩而记忆单词。

This is not that. We want to be clear: **Mastery is _not_ about memorization**.  
不是这样的。我们要明确：掌握不是死记硬背。

The point is not to memorize a text verbatim so you can pedantically rattle off some passage word-for-word at a cocktail party. (Even though that could be cool.)  
重点不是逐字逐句地背诵课文，以便在鸡尾酒会上迂腐地逐字逐句背诵某些段落。(尽管那可能很酷）。

No, the point is to reprogram your brain. To prime your mind to spot patterns, form connections, and resurface the right idea at the right time.  
不，重点是重新编程您的大脑。使您的大脑能够发现模式，形成联系，并在正确的时间重新浮现正确的想法。

Let me give you an example.  
让我给您举个例子。

When I first began experimenting with the prototype that evolved into Readwise, one of the first books I "mastered" was _Deep Survival_ by Laurence Gonzales. It's about how people find themselves in "survival situations" and why so few get out.  
当我第一次开始尝试将原型演变成Readwise时，我最先 "掌握 "的一本书是劳伦斯-冈萨雷斯（Laurence Gonzales）的《深度生存》（Deep Survival）。这本书讲述了人们是如何发现自己处于 "生存境地 "的，以及为什么很少有人能逃出生天。

As it turns out, one of the most common survival situations is hiking. Specifically, hikers who lose the trail because they fail to appreciate that way _out_ will look different than the way _in_.  
事实证明，最常见的生存状况之一就是徒步旅行。特别是，徒步旅行者因为没有意识到出路与进路的不同而迷失方向。

A few months after I'd read _Deep Survival_, I found myself nearing such a situation. I was two or three hours into one of those remote, four-hour hikes through the Costa Rican jungle, trying to find some Instagrammable waterfall, when gradually (not suddenly) the trail began to fade.  
在我读完《深海求生》一书几个月后，我发现自己正面临这样的情况。我在哥斯达黎加的丛林中徒步旅行了两三个小时，试图找到一些可以在Instagram上发布的瀑布。

It was so impercepible that my former self would have never noticed. But somewhere, deep inside the recesses of my subconscious, a pattern was matched. This triggered a flood of cautionary tales from _Deep Survival_ to be released in my mind.  
它是如此难以察觉，以至于我以前的自己根本不会注意到。但是，在我潜意识深处的某个角落，一个模式被匹配了。这引发了我脑海中涌现出大量来自 "深度生存 "的警示故事。

"Slow down." "慢点"

"Look for landmarks." "寻找地标

"Turn around and take note of the path on the way out."  
"转过身去，注意出去的路"

We heeded this advice and cautiously proceeded until the trail reappeared. Disaster was averted. On the way out, I began to reflect on what had just happened.  
我们听从了这一建议，小心翼翼地前行，直到小路重新出现。灾难得以避免。在离开的路上，我开始反思刚刚发生的事情。

There was no ruler-wielding teacher at the front of the classroom quizzing me on the periodic symbol for argon. No, this was something profound. Something intuitive.  
教室前面没有挥舞着尺子的老师在考我氩的周期符号。不，这是很深奥的东西。直观的东西。

The right ideas had popped into my head at exactly the right time, all as a result of a few minutes a day invested not only into reading books, but also into actively reviewing the best parts of those books.  
正确的想法在正确的时间出现在我的脑海中，这一切都归功于我每天花几分钟时间阅读书籍，并积极回顾这些书籍中的精华部分。

This was — dare I say — wisdom.  
这就是--我敢说--智慧。

The hike in Costa Rica was the first time I consciously noticed the phenomenon of the right idea from a book popping into my head at the right time. But afterwards, I started to notice it happening to me all the time, throughout the day, in a variety of contexts.  
在哥斯达黎加徒步旅行的时候，我第一次有意识地注意到这种现象：在适当的时候，书中的正确想法突然出现在我的脑海中。但在那之后，我开始注意到这种现象每天都在我身上发生，在不同的场合。

You can make this happen in your mind too, for any subject you want.  
您也可以在您的头脑中实现这一点，对于任何您想要的主题。

For example, if you apply Mastery to _Deep Work_ and your weekly calendar starts to fill with shallow calls and meetings, your mind will likely notice the pattern and then start nudging you to create some uninterrupted space. Maybe I should schedule a four-hour focus block to protect that currently unoccupied Thursday morning?  
例如，如果您将 "精通 "应用于 "深度工作"，而您的周历上开始充斥着浅层次的电话和会议，您的大脑很可能会注意到这种模式，然后开始提醒您创造一些不间断的空间。也许我应该安排一个4小时的专注区块，以保护目前闲置的周四上午？

If you apply Mastery to _[Triangle Selling](https://www.amazon.com/Triangle-Selling-Sales-Fundamentals-Growth-ebook/dp/B07LGKYDNZ)_ and you revert to talking about features and benefits in a client pitch, your mind will likely call you out and then start nudging you to present your product using pain-based discovery questions including social proof and emotional words. Many of our customers are frustrated by the inefficiency of books because they spend all this time reading, but forget so much, leading to so little change. Does that resonate with you?  
如果您将 "精通 "运用到三角销售中，而您在向客户推销时又回到了谈论功能和优点的状态，那么您的头脑很可能会叫醒您，然后开始提示您使用基于痛点的发现问题（包括社会证明和情感词汇）来介绍您的产品。我们的许多客户都对书本的低效率感到沮丧，因为他们花了那么多时间阅读，却忘记了很多东西，导致改变甚微。您对此有共鸣吗？

The sky is the limit. 天高任鸟飞。

## Wrapping Up 总结

Of course, the other problem with reading compared to the brain-computer interface in _The Matrix_ is bandwidth. It takes much longer to read a book and then Master it using Readwise than it does for Tank to insert a cartridge and push the upload button. But until Elon Musk finishes his [Neuralink](https://www.neuralink.com/), the combination of books, Readwise, and Mastery is one of the most effective techniques we've got.  
当然，与《黑客帝国》中的脑机接口相比，阅读的另一个问题是带宽。阅读一本书，然后用Readwise掌握它，比Tank插入墨盒并按下上传按钮所需的时间要长得多。但在Elon Musk完成他的Neuralink之前，书籍、Readwise和Mastery的结合是我们所拥有的最有效的技术之一。
