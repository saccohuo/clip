It’s over. Facebook is [in decline](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/30/facebook-scrambles-to-escape-death-spiral-as-users-flee-sales-drop.html), Twitter [in chaos](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/elon-musk-twitter-nightmare-scenarios/671906/). Mark Zuckerberg’s empire has [lost](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-stock-down-earnings-700-billion-in-lost-value/) hundreds of billions of dollars in value and [laid off](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-parent-meta-to-cut-11-000-jobs-11667992427) 11,000 people, with its ad business in peril and its [metaverse fantasy](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-name-change/620449/) in irons. Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter has caused [advertisers](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/04/technology/twitter-advertisers.html) to pull spending and power users to shun the platform (or at least to tweet a lot about doing so). It’s never felt more plausible that the age of social media might end—and soon.

结束了。 Facebook [在衰落](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/30/facebook-scrambles-to-escape-death-spiral-as-users-flee-sales-drop.html) ，Twitter [在混乱](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/elon-musk-twitter-nightmare-scenarios/671906/) 。 马克扎克伯格的帝国已经 [损失了](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-stock-down-earnings-700-billion-in-lost-value/) 数千亿美元的价值并 [解雇了](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-parent-meta-to-cut-11-000-jobs-11667992427) 11,000 人，其广告业务处于危险之中，其 [元宇宙幻想](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-name-change/620449/) 也已成定局。 Elon Musk 对 Twitter 的接管导致 [广告商](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/04/technology/twitter-advertisers.html) 拉动支出并迫使用户避开该平台（或者至少在推特上发布了很多关于这样做的信息）。 社交媒体时代可能结束——而且很快就会结束——这一点从未像现在这样可信。

Now that we’ve washed up on this unexpected shore, we can look back at the shipwreck that left us here with fresh eyes. Perhaps we can find some relief: Social media was never a natural way to work, play, and socialize, though it did become second nature. The practice evolved via a weird mutation, one so subtle that it was difficult to spot happening in the moment.

既然我们已经冲上了这个意想不到的海岸，我们就可以用全新的眼光回顾把我们留在这里的海难了。 也许我们可以找到一些解脱：社交媒体从来都不是工作、娱乐和社交的自然方式，尽管它确实成为了第二天性。 这种做法是通过一种奇怪的突变演变而来的，这种突变非常微妙，以至于很难在当下发现正在发生的事情。

The shift began 20 years ago or so, when networked computers became sufficiently ubiquitous that people began using them to build and manage relationships. Social networking had its problems—collecting friends instead of, well, being friendly with them, for example—but they were modest compared with what followed. Slowly and without fanfare, around the end of the aughts, social media took its place. The change was almost invisible, but it had enormous consequences. Instead of facilitating the modest use of existing connections—largely for offline life (to organize a birthday party, say)—social software turned those connections into a latent broadcast channel. All at once, billions of people saw themselves as celebrities, pundits, and tastemakers.

这种转变始于大约 20 年前，当时联网的计算机变得无处不在，以至于人们开始使用它们来建立和管理关系。 社交网络有它的问题——例如，结交朋友而不是，好吧，与他们保持友好——但与随后发生的事情相比，它们是适度的。 慢慢地，没有大张旗鼓，在事情快结束的时候，社交媒体取而代之。 这种变化几乎是无形的，但它产生了巨大的影响。 社交软件并没有促进现有连接的适度使用——主要用于线下生活（比如组织生日聚会）——而是将这些连接转变为潜在的广播渠道。 一时间，数十亿人将自己视为名人、专家和时尚引领者。

A global broadcast network where anyone can say anything to anyone else as often as possible, and where such people have come to think they _deserve_ such a capacity, or even that withholding it amounts to censorship or suppression—that’s just a terrible idea from the outset. And it’s a terrible idea that is entirely and completely bound up with the concept of social media itself: systems erected and used exclusively to deliver an endless stream of content.

一个全球广播网络，任何人都可以尽可能多地对其他人说任何话，而这些人开始认为他们 _应该拥有_ 这样的能力，甚至认为拒绝这种能力就等于审查或压制——从一开始这就是一个糟糕的想法. 这是一个完全和完全与社交媒体本身的概念相关的糟糕想法：建立和专门用于提供无穷无尽的内容流的系统。

But now, perhaps, it can also end. The possible downfall of Facebook and Twitter (and others) is an opportunity—not to shift to some equivalent platform, but to embrace their ruination, something previously unthinkable.

但现在，或许，也可以结束了。 Facebook 和 Twitter（以及其他）可能的垮台是一个机会——不是转移到某个等效平台，而是拥抱它们的毁灭，这在以前是不可想象的。

A long time ago, many social networks walked the Earth. Six Degrees launched in 1997, named after a Pulitzer-nominated [play](https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-categories) based on a [psychological experiment](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/milgram67smallworld.pdf). It shut down soon after the dot-com crash of 2000—the world wasn’t ready yet. Friendster arose from its ashes in 2002, followed by MySpace and LinkedIn the next year, then Hi5 and Facebook in 2004, the latter for students at select colleges and universities. That year also saw the arrival of Orkut, made and operated by Google. Bebo launched in 2005; eventually both AOL and Amazon would own it. Google Buzz and Google+ were born and then killed. You’ve probably never heard of some of these, but before Facebook was everywhere, many of these services were immensely popular.

很久以前，许多社交网络遍布地球。 命名 [的普利策提名戏剧](https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-categories) 六度 (Six Degrees) 于 1997 年推出，以一部基于 [心理学实验](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/milgram67smallworld.pdf) 。 它在 2000 年互联网泡沫破灭后不久就倒闭了——世界还没有准备好。 Friendster 于 2002 年从灰烬中重生，紧随其后的是 MySpace 和 LinkedIn，然后是 2004 年的 Hi5 和 Facebook，后者面向特定学院和大学的学生。 那一年还见证了由谷歌制造和运营的 Orkut 的到来。 Bebo于2005年推出； 最终 AOL 和亚马逊都将拥有它。 Google Buzz 和 Google+ 诞生，然后消亡。 您可能从未听说过其中一些服务，但在 Facebook 无处不在之前，其中许多服务都非常受欢迎。

Content-sharing sites also acted as de facto social networks, allowing people to see material posted mostly by people they knew or knew of, rather than from across the entire world. Flickr, the photo-sharing site, was one; YouTube—once seen as Flickr for video—was another. Blogs (and bloglike services, such as Tumblr) raced alongside them, hosting “musings” seen by few and engaged by fewer. In 2008, the Dutch media theorist Geert Lovink published a book about blogs and social networks whose title summarized their average reach: _Zero Comments_.

内容共享网站也充当了事实上的社交网络，让人们可以看到主要由他们认识或知道的人发布的材料，而不是来自全世界的人。 照片共享网站 Flickr 就是其中之一。 YouTube——曾经被视为视频的 Flickr——是另一个。 博客（和类似博客的服务，如 Tumblr）与他们并驾齐驱，承载着少数人看到和参与的“思考”。 2008 年，荷兰媒体理论家 Geert Lovink 出版了一本关于博客和社交网络的书，书名概括了它们的平均影响力： _零评论_ 。

Today, people refer to all of these services and more as “social media,” a name so familiar that it has ceased to bear meaning. But two decades ago, that term didn’t exist. Many of these sites framed themselves as a part of a “web 2.0” revolution in “user-generated content,” offering easy-to-use, easily adopted tools on websites and then mobile apps. They were built for creating and sharing “content,” a term that had previously meant “satisfied” when pronounced differently. But at the time, and for years, these offerings were framed as _social networks_ or, more often, _social-network services_. So many SNSes proliferated, a joke acronym arose: YASN, or “yet another social network.” These things were _everywhere_, like dandelions in springtime.

今天，人们将所有这些服务以及更多的服务称为“社交媒体”，这个名字如此熟悉以至于它已经失去了意义。 但二十年前，这个词并不存在。 其中许多网站将自己定位为“用户生成内容”的“web 2.0”革命的一部分，在网站和移动应用程序上提供易于使用、易于采用的工具。 它们是为创建和共享“内容”而构建的，这个术语以前在发音不同时表示“满意”。 但在当时以及多年来，这些产品被设计为 _社交网络_ ，或者更常见的是 _社交网络服务_ 。 如此多的 SNS 激增，出现了一个开玩笑的首字母缩略词：YASN，或“又一个社交网络”。 这些东西 _无处不在_ ，就像春天的蒲公英。

As the original name suggested, social networking involved _connecting_, not publishing. By connecting your personal network of trusted contacts (or “strong ties,” as sociologists call them) to others’ such networks (via “weak ties”), you could surface a larger network of trusted contacts. LinkedIn promised to make job searching and business networking possible by traversing the connections of your connections. Friendster did so for personal relationships, Facebook for college mates, and so on. The whole idea of social networks was _networking_: building or deepening relationships, mostly with people you knew. How and why that deepening happened was largely left to the users to decide.

顾名思义，社交网络涉及 _连接_ ，而不是发布。 通过将您的个人可信联系人网络（或社会学家称之为“强关系”）连接到其他人的此类网络（通过“弱关系”），您可以建立更大的可信联系人网络。 LinkedIn 承诺通过遍历你的人脉关系，使求职和商业网络成为可能。 Friendster 这样做是为了建立人际关系，Facebook 是为了大学同学，等等。 社交网络的整体理念就是 _联网_ ：建立或加深关系，主要是与您认识的人。 这种深化如何以及为何发生在很大程度上由用户决定。

That changed when _social networking_ became _social media_ around 2009, between the introduction of the smartphone and the launch of Instagram. Instead of connection—forging latent ties to people and organizations we would mostly ignore—social media offered platforms through which people could publish content as widely as possible, well beyond their networks of immediate contacts. Social media turned you, me, and everyone into broadcasters (if aspirational ones). The results have been disastrous but also highly pleasurable, not to mention massively profitable—a catastrophic combination.

当 _社交网络_ 在 2009 年左右成为 _社交媒体_ 时，在智能手机的推出和 Instagram 的推出之间，情况发生了变化。 社交媒体提供的平台不是连接——与我们通常会忽略的人和组织建立潜在联系——而是提供平台，人们可以通过这些平台尽可能广泛地发布内容，远远超出他们的直接联系网络。 社交媒体把你、我和每个人都变成了广播员（如果有抱负的话）。 结果是灾难性的，但也非常令人愉快，更不用说巨额利润了——这是一个灾难性的组合。

The terms _social network_ and _social media_ are used interchangeably now, but they shouldn’t be. A social network is an idle, inactive system—a Rolodex of contacts, a notebook of sales targets, a yearbook of possible soul mates. But social media is active—hyperactive, really—spewing material across those networks instead of leaving them alone until needed.

这两个术语 _社交网络_ 和 _社交媒体_ 现在可以互换使用，但它们不应该互换使用。 社交网络是一个闲置的、不活跃的系统——联系人名片夹、销售目标笔记本、可能的灵魂伴侣年鉴。 但是社交媒体是活跃的——实际上是极度活跃的——在这些网络上大量涌现资料，而不是让它们在需要的时候独处。

A 2003 [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220711261_Someone_A_Cooperative_System_for_Personalized_Information_Exchange) published in _Enterprise Information Systems_ made an early case that drives the point home. The authors propose social media as a system in which users participate in “information exchange.” The network, which had previously been used to establish and maintain relationships, becomes reinterpreted as a channel through which to broadcast.

2003 年 [) 上的一篇论文](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220711261_Someone_A_Cooperative_System_for_Personalized_Information_Exchange) 发表在《 _企业信息系统》( Enterprise Information Systems_ 提出了一个早期案例来说明这一点。 作者提出社交媒体是用户参与“信息交换”的系统。 以前用于建立和维持关系的网络被重新解释为传播的渠道。

This was a novel concept. When News Corp, a media company, bought MySpace in 2005, _The_ _New York Times_ [called](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/18/business/news-corp-to-acquire-owner-of-myspacecom.html) the website a “a youth-oriented music and ‘social networking’ site”—complete with scare quotes. The site’s primary content, music, was seen as separate from its social-networking functions. Even Zuckerberg’s vision for Facebook, to “[connect every person in the world](https://time.com/facebook-world-plan/),” implied a networking function, not media distribution.

这是一个新颖的概念。 当媒体公司新闻集团在 2005 年收购 MySpace 时， _《_ _纽约时报》_ [称](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/18/business/news-corp-to-acquire-owner-of-myspacecom.html) 该网站为“一个面向青年的音乐和‘社交网络’网站”——并附上吓人的引语。 该网站的主要内容，音乐，被视为独立于其社交网络功能。 即使是扎克伯格对 Facebook 的愿景，即“ [连接世界上的每个人](https://time.com/facebook-world-plan/) ”，也暗示了一种网络功能，而不是媒体分发。

The toxicity of social media makes it easy to forget how truly magical this innovation felt when it was new. From 2004 to 2009, you could join Facebook and everyone you’d ever known—including people you’d definitely lost track of—was right there, ready to connect or reconnect. The posts and photos I saw characterized my friends’ changing lives, not the conspiracy theories that their unhinged friends had shared with them. LinkedIn did the same thing with business contacts, making referrals, dealmaking, and job hunting much easier than they had been previously. I started a game studio in 2003, when LinkedIn was brand new, and I inked our first deal by working connections there.

社交媒体的毒性让人很容易忘记这项创新在刚刚出现时的真实感受。 从 2004 年到 2009 年，你可以加入 Facebook，你认识的每个人——包括你肯定已经失去联系的人——都在那里，随时准备联系或重新联系。 我看到的帖子和照片描绘了我朋友不断变化的生活，而不是他们精神错乱的朋友与他们分享的阴谋论。 LinkedIn 在业务联系人方面做了同样的事情，使推荐、交易和找工作比以前容易得多。 我在 2003 年创办了一家游戏工作室，当时 LinkedIn 还是一个全新的公司，我通过在那里的人脉关系签下了我们的第一笔交易。

Twitter, which launched in 2006, was probably the first true social-media site, even if nobody called it that at the time. Instead of focusing on connecting people, the site amounted to a giant, asynchronous chat room for the world. Twitter was for talking to _everyone_—which is perhaps one of the reasons journalists have flocked to it. Sure, a blog could technically be read by anybody with a web browser, but in practice finding that readership was hard. That’s why blogs operated first as social networks, through mechanisms such as blogrolls and linkbacks. But on Twitter, anything anybody posted could be seen instantly by anyone else. And furthermore, unlike posts on blogs or images on Flickr or videos on YouTube, tweets were short and low-effort, making it easy to post many of them a week or even a day.

2006 年推出的 Twitter 可能是第一个真正的社交媒体网站，即使当时没有人这样称呼它。 该站点不是专注于连接人们，而是相当于一个巨大的、异步的世界聊天室。 Twitter 是用来与 _所有人_ 交谈的——这也许是记者蜂拥而至的原因之一。 当然，从技术上讲，任何人都可以使用网络浏览器阅读博客，但实际上很难找到读者群。 这就是为什么博客首先通过 blogrolls 和 linkbacks 等机制作为社交网络运作的原因。 但在 Twitter 上，任何人发布的任何内容都可以立即被其他人看到。 此外，与博客上的帖子或 Flickr 上的图片或 YouTube 上的视频不同，推文简短且省力，因此很容易在一周甚至一天内发布许多推文。

The notion of a global “town square,” as [Elon Musk has put it](https://analyticsindiamag.com/will-musk-walk-the-talk-on-free-speech-post-twitter-acquisition/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt's%20really%20important%20for%20an,said%20in%20his%20TED%20talk.), emerges from all of these factors. On Twitter, you can instantly learn about a tsunami in Tōhoku or an omakase in Topeka. This is also why journalists became so [dependent on](https://twitter.com/evefairbanks/status/1589276140757487616?s=20&t=4bJy7X5WSuR1nh4QVyggJQ) Twitter: It’s a constant stream of sources, events, and reactions—a reporting automat, not to mention an outbound vector for media tastemakers to make tastes.

，全球“城市广场”的概念 [正如埃隆马斯克所说](https://analyticsindiamag.com/will-musk-walk-the-talk-on-free-speech-post-twitter-acquisition/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt's%20really%20important%20for%20an,said%20in%20his%20TED%20talk.) 源于所有这些因素。 在 Twitter 上，您可以立即了解东北地区的海啸或托皮卡的 omakase。 这也是记者变得如此 [依赖](https://twitter.com/evefairbanks/status/1589276140757487616?s=20&t=4bJy7X5WSuR1nh4QVyggJQ) Twitter 的原因：它是来源、事件和反应的源源不断的流——一个报告自动机，更不用说媒体品味制造者制作品味的出站载体。

When we look back at this moment, social media had already arrived in spirit if not by name. RSS readers offered a feed of blog posts to catch up on, complete with unread counts. MySpace fused music and chatter; YouTube did it with video (“[Broadcast Yourself](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=broadcast%20yourself)”). In 2005, at an industry conference, I remember overhearing an attendee say, “I’m so behind on my Flickr!” _What does that even mean?_ I recall wondering. But now the answer is obvious: creating and consuming content for any reason, or no reason. Social media was overtaking social networking.

当我们回顾这一刻时，社交媒体即使不是名副其实，也已名存实亡。 RSS 阅读器提供了一个博客文章提要供您阅读，包括未读数量。 MySpace 融合了音乐和聊天； YouTube 通过视频（“ [Broadcast Yourself](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=broadcast%20yourself) ”）做到了这一点。 2005 年，在一次行业会议上，我记得无意中听到一位与会者说：“我的 Flickr 太落后了！” _那有什么意思？_ 我记得想知道。 但现在答案很明显：出于任何原因或无原因地创建和使用内容。 社交媒体正在超越社交网络。

Instagram, launched in 2010, might have built the bridge between the social-network era and the age of social media. It relied on the connections among users as a mechanism to distribute content as a primary activity. But soon enough, all social networks became social media first and foremost. When groups, pages, and the News Feed launched, Facebook began encouraging users to share content published by others in order to increase engagement on the service, rather than to provide updates to friends. LinkedIn launched a program to publish content across the platform, too. Twitter, already principally a publishing platform, added a dedicated “retweet” feature, making it far easier to spread content virally across user networks.

Instagram 于 2010 年推出，可能在社交网络时代和社交媒体时代之间架起了一座桥梁。 它依靠用户之间的联系作为一种机制，将内容分发作为主要活动。 但很快，所有社交网络首先成为了社交媒体。 当群组、页面和动态消息推出时，Facebook 开始鼓励用户分享他人发布的内容，以增加对该服务的参与度，而不是向朋友提供更新。 LinkedIn 也推出了一个跨平台发布内容的计划。 Twitter 已经主要是一个发布平台，增加了一个专门的“转发”功能，使得在用户网络中病毒式传播内容变得更加容易。

Other services arrived or evolved in this vein, among them Reddit, Snapchat, and WhatsApp, all far more popular than Twitter. Social networks, once latent routes for possible contact, became superhighways of constant content. In their latest phase, their social-networking aspects have been pushed deep into the background. Although you can connect the app to your contacts and follow specific users, on TikTok, you are more likely to simply plug into a continuous flow of video content that has [oozed to the surface via algorithm](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/tiktok-instagram-video-feeds-ai-algorithm/672002/). You still have to connect with other users to use some of these services’ features. But connection as a primary purpose has declined. Think of the change like this: In the social-networking era, the connections were essential, driving both content creation and consumption. But the social-media era seeks the thinnest, most soluble connections possible, just enough to allow the content to flow.

其他服务以这种方式出现或发展，其中包括 Reddit、Snapchat 和 WhatsApp，它们都比 Twitter 更受欢迎。 社交网络曾经是可能接触的潜在途径，现在变成了内容不断的高速公路。 在他们的最新阶段，他们的社交网络方面已被推到后台。 尽管您可以将该应用程序连接到您的联系人并关注特定用户，但在 TikTok 上，您更有可能简单地插入 [通过算法渗入表面](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/tiktok-instagram-video-feeds-ai-algorithm/672002/) 的连续视频内容流。 您仍然需要与其他用户联系才能使用其中一些服务的功能。 但连接作为主要目的已经下降。 想想这样的变化：在社交网络时代，联系是必不可少的，它推动了内容的创造和消费。 但社交媒体时代寻求尽可能最薄、最易溶解的连接，刚好足以让内容流动。

Social networks’ evolution into social media brought both opportunity and calamity. Facebook and all the rest enjoyed a massive rise in engagement and the associated data-driven advertising profits that the attention-driven content economy created. The same phenomenon also created the influencer economy, in which individual social-media users became valuable as channels for distributing marketing messages or product sponsorships by means of their posts’ real or imagined reach. Ordinary folk could now make some money or even a lucrative living “creating content” online. The platforms sold them on that promise, creating official programs and mechanisms to facilitate it. In turn, “influencer” became an aspirational role, especially for young people for whom Instagram fame seemed more achievable than traditional celebrity—or perhaps employment of any kind.

社交网络向社交媒体的演变既带来了机遇也带来了灾难。 Facebook 和其他所有公司都享有参与度的大幅上升以及由注意力驱动的内容经济创造的相关数据驱动的广告利润。 同样的现象也创造了影响者经济，其中个人社交媒体用户通过其帖子的真实或想象的影响力作为分发营销信息或产品赞助的渠道变得有价值。 普通人现在可以在网上“创造内容”赚钱，甚至可以过上丰厚的生活。 这些平台以该承诺出售它们，创建官方程序和机制来促进它。 反过来，“影响者”成为了一个令人向往的角色，尤其是对于年轻人来说，他们在 Instagram 上的名声似乎比传统名人或任何形式的就业更容易实现。

The ensuing disaster was multipart. For one, social-media operators discovered that the more emotionally charged the content, the better it spread across its users’ networks. Polarizing, offensive, or just plain fraudulent information was optimized for distribution. By the time the platforms realized and the public revolted, it was too late to turn off these feedback loops.

随之而来的灾难是多方面的。 其一，社交媒体运营商发现，内容越是充满情感，它在用户网络中的传播就越好。 两极分化的、冒犯性的或只是简单的欺诈性信息已针对分发进行了优化。 当平台意识到并引起公众反抗时，关闭这些反馈回路为时已晚。

Obsession fueled the flames. Compulsion had always plagued computer-facilitated social networking—it was the original sin. Rounding up friends or business contacts into a pen in your online profile for possible future use was never a healthy way to understand social relationships. It was just as common to obsess over having 500-plus connections on LinkedIn in 2003 as it is to covet Instagram followers today. But when social networking evolved into social media, user expectations escalated. Driven by venture capitalists’ expectations and then Wall Street’s demands, the tech companies—Google and Facebook and all the rest—became addicted to massive scale. And the values associated with scale—reaching a lot of people easily and cheaply, and reaping the benefits—became appealing to everyone: a journalist earning reputational capital on Twitter; a 20-something seeking sponsorship on Instagram; a dissident spreading word of their cause on YouTube; an insurrectionist sowing rebellion on Facebook; an autopornographer selling sex, or its image, on OnlyFans; a self-styled guru hawking advice on LinkedIn. Social media showed that everyone has the _potential_ to reach a massive audience at low cost and high gain—and that potential gave many people the impression that they _deserve_ such an audience.

痴迷助长了火焰。 强迫症一直困扰着计算机辅助的社交网络——这是原罪。 在您的在线个人资料中将朋友或业务联系人汇总到一支笔中以供将来可能使用，这从来都不是了解社会关系的健康方式。 2003 年痴迷于在 LinkedIn 上拥有 500 多个联系人就像今天垂涎 Instagram 粉丝一样普遍。 但是，当社交网络演变成社交媒体时，用户的期望值不断提高。 在风险资本家的期望和随后华尔街的要求的推动下，科技公司——谷歌和 Facebook 以及其他所有公司——开始沉迷于大规模扩张。 与规模相关的价值——轻松、廉价地接触到很多人，并从中获益——对每个人都有吸引力：一名记者在 Twitter 上赚取声誉资本； 在 Instagram 上寻求赞助的 20 多岁； 持不同政见者在 YouTube 上传播他们的事业； 叛乱分子在 Facebook 上播种叛乱； 在 OnlyFans 上出售性或其图像的自拍色情者； 在 LinkedIn 上自封为大师的贩卖建议。 社交媒体表明每个人都有 _应该_ 以低成本和高收益接触大量受众的潜力——这种潜力给许多人留下了这样的印象：他们 _得到_ 这样的受众。

The flip side of that coin also shines. On social media, everyone believes that anyone to whom they have access _owes_ them an audience: a writer who posted a take, a celebrity who announced a project, a pretty girl just trying to live her life, that anon who said something afflictive. When network connections become activated for any reason or no reason, then every connection seems worthy of traversing.

那枚硬币的反面也闪闪发光。 在社交媒体上，每个人都认为，他们可以接触到的任何人都 _欠_ 他们一个观众：一位发布了拍摄的作家，一位宣布了一个项目的名人，一个只想过自己生活的漂亮女孩，一个说了一些令人难过的话的匿名者。 当网络连接因任何原因或无原因被激活时，每个连接似乎都值得遍历。

That was a terrible idea. As I’ve written before on this subject, [people just aren’t meant to talk to one another this much](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/fix-facebook-making-it-more-like-google/620456/). They shouldn’t have that much to say, they shouldn’t expect to receive such a large audience for that expression, and they shouldn’t suppose a right to comment or rejoinder for every thought or notion either. From being asked to review every product you buy to believing that every tweet or Instagram image warrants likes or comments or follows, social media produced a positively unhinged, sociopathic rendition of human sociality. That’s no surprise, I guess, given that the model was forged in the fires of Big Tech companies such as Facebook, where sociopathy is a design philosophy.

那是个糟糕的主意。 正如我之前写过的关于这个主题的文章， [人们只是不应该互相交谈那么多](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/fix-facebook-making-it-more-like-google/620456/) 。 他们不应该有那么多话要说，他们不应该期望这种表达会得到如此多的听众，他们也不应该认为自己有权对每一个想法或想法发表评论或反驳。 从被要求评论你购买的每件产品，到相信每条推文或 Instagram 图片都值得点赞、评论或关注，社交媒体对人类社会性产生了一种精神错乱、反社会的演绎。 我想这并不奇怪，因为该模型是在 Facebook 等大型科技公司的大火中锻造出来的，反社会是一种设计理念。

If Twitter does fail, either because its [revenue collapses](https://twitter.com/GoAngelo/status/1588696157794242560) or because the [massive debt](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/technology/elon-musk-twitter-debt.html) that Musk’s deal imposes crushes it, the result could help accelerate social media’s decline more generally. It would also be tragic for those who have come to rely on these platforms, for news or community or conversation or mere compulsion. Such is the hypocrisy of this moment. The rush of likes and shares felt so good because the age of zero comments felt so lonely—and upscaling killed the alternatives a long time ago, besides.

如果 Twitter 确实失败了，要么是因为它的 [收入崩溃](https://twitter.com/GoAngelo/status/1588696157794242560) 的 [巨额债务](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/30/technology/elon-musk-twitter-debt.html) ，要么是因为马斯克的交易强加 压垮了它，结果可能有助于加速社交媒体更普遍的衰落。 对于那些为了新闻、社区、对话或仅仅是强迫而依赖这些平台的人来说，这也将是悲剧。 这就是此时此刻的虚伪。 点赞和分享的热潮让人感觉如此美好，因为零评论的时代让人感到如此孤独——此外，很久以前，升级就扼杀了其他选择。

If change is possible, carrying it out will be difficult, because we have adapted our lives to conform to social media’s pleasures and torments. It’s seemingly as hard to give up on social media as it was to give up smoking en masse, like Americans did in the 20th century. Quitting that habit took decades of regulatory intervention, public-relations campaigning, social shaming, and aesthetic shifts. At a cultural level, we didn’t stop smoking just because the habit was unpleasant or uncool or even because it might kill us. We did so slowly and over time, by forcing social life to suffocate the practice. That process must now begin in earnest for social media.

如果改变是可能的，实施起来将是困难的，因为我们已经调整了我们的生活以适应社交媒体的快乐和折磨。 戒烟似乎和戒烟一样难，就像美国人在 20 世纪所做的那样。 戒掉这个习惯需要数十年的监管干预、公关活动、社会羞辱和审美转变。 在文化层面上，我们戒烟并不仅仅因为这个习惯令人不快或不酷，甚至因为它可能要了我们的命。 随着时间的推移，我们通过强迫社交生活扼杀这种做法，慢慢地做到了这一点。 对于社交媒体来说，这个过程现在必须认真开始。

Something may yet survive the fire that would burn it down: social networks, the services’ overlooked, molten core. It was never a _terrible_ idea, at least, to use computers to connect to one another on occasion, for justified reasons, and in moderation (although the risk of instrumentalizing one another was present from the outset). The problem came from doing so all the time, as a lifestyle, an aspiration, an obsession. The offer was always too good to be true, but it’s taken us two decades to realize the Faustian nature of the bargain. Someday, eventually, perhaps its web will unwind. But not soon, and not easily.

有些东西可能会在将其烧毁的大火中幸存下来：社交网络、服务被忽视的熔融核心。 从来都不是一个 _糟糕_ 至少，出于正当理由并适度使用计算机相互连接 的想法（尽管从一开始就存在相互工具化的风险）。 问题来自于一直这样做，作为一种生活方式，一种愿望，一种痴迷。 报价总是好得令人难以置信，但我们花了二十年时间才意识到这笔交易的浮士德式本质。 也许有一天，它的网最终会展开。 但不会很快，也不会轻易。

A year ago, [when I first wrote about downscale](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/fix-facebook-making-it-more-like-google/620456/), the ambition seemed necessary but impossible. It still feels unlikely—but perhaps newly plausible. That’s a victory, if a small one, so long as the withdrawal doesn’t drive us back to the addiction. To win the soul of social life, we must learn to muzzle it again, across the globe, among billions of people. To speak less, to fewer people and less often—and for them to do the same to you, and everyone else as well. We cannot make social media good, because it is fundamentally bad, deep in its very structure. All we can do is hope that it withers away, and play our small part in helping abandon it.

一年前， [当我第一次写关于 downscale](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/fix-facebook-making-it-more-like-google/620456/) 的文章时，雄心壮志似乎是必要的，但却是不可能的。 它仍然感觉不太可能——但也许是新的似是而非的。 这是一个胜利，即使是一个小胜利，只要退出不会让我们重新上瘾。 为了赢得社会生活的灵魂，我们必须学会在全球数十亿人中再次压制它。 少说话，少说话，少说话——让他们对你和其他人做同样的事情。 我们不能让社交媒体变好，因为它从根本上来说是坏的，深入到它的结构中。 我们所能做的就是希望它枯萎，并在帮助放弃它方面发挥我们的作用。
