If I asked, which do you think will lead to a healthier, happier relationship:  

如果我问，你认为哪种方式会让你的关系更健康、更幸福？

-   An arranged marriage by someone who doesn’t know you.  
    
    由不了解你的人包办婚姻。
    
-   Spending years meeting hundreds of people with different backgrounds, figuring out what you want and don’t want, and serendipitously meeting your partner only when you both happen to be ready to settle down.  
    
    花数年时间去见成百上千不同背景的人，弄清楚自己想要什么，不想要什么，然后在双方都准备好安定下来的时候才偶然遇到自己的伴侣。
    

The answer is obvious (to me, at least).  

答案显而易见（至少对我来说是这样）。

The first you could call active search. It’s managed on a timeline, has rules, and is done whether you’re ready or not.  

第一种可以称为主动搜索。它有时间表，有规则，无论你是否准备好，都可以进行。

The second, let’s call passive. You’re in control and you let it happen whenever it happens given what you want and where you are in life.  

第二种，我们称之为被动搜索。你可以掌控一切，根据自己的需求和生活状态，让它随时发生。

I think the same logic applies to what I’ve been thinking of as active vs. passive learning.  

我认为同样的逻辑也适用于我一直认为的主动学习和被动学习。

I’d define it like this:  

我会这样定义它：

**Active learning**: Someone tells you what to learn, how to learn it, on a set schedule, on pre-selected standardized topics.  

主动学习：有人告诉你要学什么、怎么学、按照既定的时间表、就预先选定的标准化主题进行学习。

**Passive learning**: You let your mind wander with no intended destination. You read and learn broadly, talk to people from various backgrounds, and stumble haphazardly across topics you had never considered but spark your curiosity, often because it’s the topic you happen to need at that specific time of your life.  

被动学习：你让自己的思想漫无目的地游荡。你广泛地阅读和学习，与来自不同背景的人交谈，偶然发现一些你从未考虑过但却能激发你好奇心的话题，通常是因为这是你在人生的特定时期恰好需要的话题。

I can’t be alone in realizing that most of what I’ve learned in life has come from passive learning.  

我认识到，我在生活中所学到的大部分知识都来自于被动学习。

Something I’ve learned as a writer is that writing for yourself is fun, and it shows, while writing for other people is work, and it shows. Doing something your way, on your own terms, because it fits your unique personality, is night and day compared with performing for someone else’s expectations.  

作为一名作家，我学到的一点是，为自己写作是一种乐趣，而且会显现出来；而为他人写作则是一种工作，而且会显现出来。按照自己的方式、自己的条件做事，因为这符合你的独特个性，这与为别人的期望而工作相比，简直是天壤之别。

Active learning – which you’ll recognize as _school_ – not only has a wonderful place in life but has to be considered one of the greatest achievements of modern times.  

主动学习--你会把它看作是学校--不仅在生活中占有一席之地，而且必须被视为现代最伟大的成就之一。

The problem is assuming it’s the only, or even the best, form of learning. Or more dangerously: people who have only experienced active learning that isn’t right for their personality may become convinced that they hate learning, hate reading, hate being curious about the world … and then it spirals down from there.  

问题在于，假设这是唯一的，甚至是最好的学习方式。更危险的是：只经历过不适合自己个性的主动学习的人，可能会认为自己讨厌学习、讨厌阅读、讨厌对世界充满好奇......然后就会越陷越深。

What gets most people’s minds moving is stumbling across a niche topic that either fits their unique mind or is a missing puzzle piece for a specific problem they’re having in life. It’s hard to foster that with active learning. You need to let people’s minds wander aimlessly, waiting until they discover what’s right for them at the time they need it.  

让大多数人的思维活跃起来的，是偶然发现一个适合他们独特思维的小众话题，或者是他们生活中遇到的特定问题所缺少的一块拼图。主动学习很难培养这种能力。你需要让人们的思维漫无目的地游荡，直到他们在需要的时候发现适合自己的东西。

I like to keep two things in mind:  

我喜欢记住两件事：

**1\. Don’t contain your learning to your own profession or major. Read and learn as broadly as possible**.  

1.不要把学习局限于自己的专业或主修科目。尽可能广泛地阅读和学习。

A big part of passive learning is going out of your way to [read and learn from the widest variety of topics you can](https://collabfund.com/blog/little-ways-the-world-works/), intentionally looking for similarities between different fields. When you do, you’ll be stunned at how easy and fun it is to stumble on a new idea that teaches you how the world works.  

被动学习的一个重要部分，就是不遗余力地阅读和学习最广泛的主题，有意识地寻找不同领域之间的相似之处。当你这样做的时候，你会惊奇地发现，偶然发现一个新的想法，让你知道世界是如何运转的，是多么容易和有趣。

If you’re in business, you’ll be shocked at how much you can learn about moats and competitive advantages from biology. If you’re in biology, you’ll be shocked at how much you can learn about growth limits and evolution from business.  

如果你是商界人士，你会惊奇地发现，从生物学中可以学到很多关于护城河和竞争优势的知识。如果你从事生物学研究，你会震惊地发现，你能从商业中学到很多关于增长极限和进化的知识。

One problem with active learning is that it tends to be siloed, with math taught in one department, chemistry in another, English in a different building. It tends to keep topics boring, and lacking real-world context.  

主动学习的一个问题是，它往往是孤立的，数学在一个系教，化学在另一个系，英语在另一栋楼。这往往会使课题枯燥乏味，缺乏真实世界的背景。

But if you study broadly enough you’ll see how interconnected every field is – many fields fall under an umbrella of “how the world deals with uncertainty and competition.” If you find something that is true in more than one field, you’ve probably uncovered something particularly important. The more fields it shows up in, the more likely it is to be a fundamental driver of how the world works.  

但是，如果你的研究范围足够广泛，你就会发现每个领域都是如此相互关联--许多领域都属于 "世界如何应对不确定性和竞争 "的范畴。如果你发现一些东西在不止一个领域都是正确的，那么你很可能发现了一些特别重要的东西。它出现的领域越多，就越有可能成为世界运行的基本驱动力。

It’s been like that forever. “The world is often wiser than any philosopher,” the journalist Walter Bagehot [wrote](https://books.google.com/books?id=iuV9Lhn53r4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) in 1859. David Senra recently summarized Jeff Bezos’s mindset: “If you’re paying attention, the whole world is a classroom.” A classroom of passive learning.  

一直以来都是这样。"记者沃尔特-贝格霍特（Walter Bagehot）在 1859 年写道："世界往往比任何哲学家都更有智慧。大卫-森拉最近总结了杰夫-贝索斯的思维模式："如果你留心观察，整个世界就是一间教室"。被动学习的课堂。

Let me give you a strange example of how one topic teaches you about another.  

让我举一个奇怪的例子，说明一个话题如何让你了解另一个话题。

Neil deGrasse Tyson once asked a group of college professors how much TV they watch. He [explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCa3zUwNaF4&ab_channel=ColemanHughes):  

尼尔-德格拉斯-泰森曾问一群大学教授他们看多少电视。他解释说

> About 15% of the audience actively watched any number of hours of TV per week. At the time the average person in America watched 30 hours of TV per week. I said to them: How could you possibly claim that you know and understand who you’re teaching? They have no idea about the influences going on in the mind of the person who you’re trying to teach.  
> 
> 大约 15%的观众每周会主动观看一定时长的电视。当时美国人平均每周看 30 小时电视。我对他们说你们怎么能说自己了解和理解你们的教学对象呢？他们根本不知道你要教的人心里在想些什么。

Few college history professors think, “If I watch South Park I’ll better understand the minds of who I’m teaching, and I’ll become a better teacher.” And few people watching South Park realize they’re actually learning how a big part of society thinks. But that’s a quirky example of the kind of broad, multi-disciplinary learning that helps you make sense of how the world works.  

很少有大学历史教授会想："如果我看了《南方公园》，我就能更好地理解我所教学生的思想，我就能成为一个更好的老师"。看《南方公园》的人也很少意识到，他们实际上是在学习社会中很大一部分人的思维方式。但这只是一个奇特的例子，这种广泛、多学科的学习有助于你了解世界是如何运作的。

Read broadly, watch broadly, discuss broadly, learn broadly.  

广泛阅读，广泛观看，广泛讨论，广泛学习。

**2\. Give employees time to think. Give yourself time to ponder.  

2.给员工思考的时间。给自己思考的时间。**

If you, as a boss, expect that learning stops at graduation and employees are merely meant to produce work, you will get the kind of employees you deserve.  

如果作为老板，你期望学习止步于毕业，而员工只是为了完成工作，那么你将得到你应得的员工。

In 1870, 46% of jobs were in agriculture, and 35% were in crafts or manufacturing, according to economist Robert Gordon. Few professions relied on a worker’s brain. You didn’t think; you _labored_, without interruption, and your work was visible and tangible.  

经济学家罗伯特-戈登（Robert Gordon）指出，1870 年，46% 的工作岗位属于农业，35% 属于手工业或制造业。很少有职业依赖工人的大脑。你不需要思考；你不间断地劳动，你的工作是看得见、摸得着的。

Today, that’s flipped. 如今，情况发生了翻天覆地的变化。

Thirty-eight percent of jobs are now designated as “managers, officials, and professionals.” These are decision-making jobs. Another 41% are service jobs that often rely on your thoughts as much as your actions.  

38%的工作现在被指定为 "经理、官员和专业人员"。这些都是决策性工作。另外 41% 的工作属于服务性工作，这些工作通常既依赖于你的思想，也依赖于你的行动。

So many of these employees will do better work if they are given time to think, learn, ponder, discuss, and let their minds roam. But they often can’t, because so many bosses expect them to be at their desk, typing, moving a mouse, 40 hours a week until age 65.  

如果有时间让员工思考、学习、思索、讨论，让他们的思维自由驰骋，那么他们中的很多人都会做得更好。但他们往往做不到，因为许多老板希望他们每周 40 小时都呆在办公桌前，敲敲键盘，动动鼠标，直到 65 岁。

Without time to passively think and learn, your education stalls between age 18 and 22, most of which likely consisted of active learning. It seems bizarre that as a boss you should give your employees idle time to do things that don’t look like productive work. But so many successful people found their key educational experiences during free time, passively, driven by their own curiosity and wandering minds.  

如果没有时间被动地思考和学习，你在 18 岁到 22 岁之间所受的教育就会停滞不前，而其中大部分可能都是主动学习。作为老板，让员工有闲暇时间做一些看起来不像是有成效的工作，这似乎很奇怪。但是，许多成功人士都是在闲暇时间被动地、在自己的好奇心和游荡的思维驱使下，找到了自己的重要教育经历。

The differences in outcomes among people with the same formal education are enormous, and a big reason why is that some people find the time to value passive learning, and others don’t.  

接受过同样正规教育的人在学习成果上的差异是巨大的，其中一个重要原因就是有些人有时间重视被动学习，而有些人则没有。
