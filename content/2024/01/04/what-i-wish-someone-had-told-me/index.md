## [What I Wish Someone Had Told Me  

我希望有人告诉我的事](https://blog.samaltman.com/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me)

1.  Optimism, obsession, self-belief, raw horsepower and personal connections are how things get started.  
    
    乐观、执着、自信、原始动力和人际关系是事情开始的方式。
2.  Cohesive teams, the right combination of calmness and urgency, and unreasonable commitment are how things get finished. Long-term orientation is in short supply; try not to worry about what people think in the short term, which will get easier over time.  
    
    有凝聚力的团队、冷静与紧迫感的恰当结合以及不合理的承诺，才能完成任务。长期导向是供不应求的；尽量不要担心人们在短期内的想法，随着时间的推移，这会变得越来越容易。
3.  It is easier for a team to do a hard thing that really matters than to do an easy thing that doesn’t really matter; audacious ideas motivate people.  
    
    对一个团队来说，做一件真正重要的难事比做一件无关紧要的容易事更容易；大胆的想法会激励人们。
4.  Incentives are superpowers; set them carefully.  
    
    激励是一种超能力，要谨慎设置。
5.  Concentrate your resources on a small number of high-conviction bets; this is easy to say but evidently hard to do. You can delete more stuff than you think.  
    
    将你的资源集中在少数高定罪率的投注上；这说起来容易，做起来显然很难。你能删除的东西比你想象的要多。
6.  Communicate clearly and concisely.  
    
    沟通简洁明了。
7.  Fight bullshit and bureaucracy every time you see it and get other people to fight it too. Do not let the org chart get in the way of people working productively together.  
    
    每次看到废话和官僚主义，就与之斗争，并让其他人也与之斗争。不要让组织结构图妨碍人们高效地协同工作。
8.  Outcomes are what count; don’t let good process excuse bad results.  
    
    结果才是最重要的，不要让好的过程成为坏结果的借口。
9.  Spend more time recruiting. Take risks on high-potential people with a fast rate of improvement. Look for evidence of getting stuff done in addition to intelligence.  
    
    花更多时间招聘。在潜力大、进步快的人身上冒险。除了聪明才智，还要看完成工作的证据。
10.  Superstars are even more valuable than they seem, but you have to evaluate people on their net impact on the performance of the organization.  
    
    超级明星比他们看起来更有价值，但你必须根据他们对组织绩效的净影响来评估他们。
11.  Fast iteration can make up for a lot; it’s usually ok to be wrong if you iterate quickly. Plans should be measured in decades, execution should be measured in weeks.  
    
    快速迭代可以弥补很多不足；如果迭代速度快，通常出错也没关系。计划应以十年为单位，执行应以周为单位。
12.  Don’t fight the business equivalent of the laws of physics.  
    
    不要与物理定律等同的商业法则作对。
13.  Inspiration is perishable and life goes by fast. Inaction is a particularly insidious type of risk.  
    
    灵感易逝，人生匆匆。不作为是一种特别隐蔽的风险。
14.  Scale often has surprising emergent properties.  
    
    规模往往具有令人惊讶的新兴特性。
15.  Compounding exponentials are magic. In particular, you really want to build a business that gets a compounding advantage with scale.  
    
    复利指数是一种魔力。尤其是，你真的想建立一个随着规模扩大而获得复利优势的企业。
16.  Get back up and keep going.  
    
    重新站起来，继续前进。
17.  Working with great people is one of the best parts of life.  
    
    与优秀的人共事是生活中最美好的部分之一。
