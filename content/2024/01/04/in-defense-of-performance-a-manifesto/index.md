---

When we started writing about performance nearly a decade ago, there was much to be said and done. We built on primary research from across domains. We drew from giants in the field such as Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (“flow”), Anders Ericsson (“deliberate practice”), and Jim Loehr (applying an athletic mindset to the workplace). We also looked to philosophy, psychology, anthropology, cognitive science, and many other areas of inquiry that had traditionally been siloed.   

近十年前，当我们开始撰写有关绩效的文章时，我们有很多话要说，也有很多事要做。我们以跨领域的初步研究为基础。我们借鉴了该领域巨匠的研究成果，如米哈伊-西克岑特米哈伊（Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi）（"流动"）、安德斯-爱立信（Anders Ericsson）（"刻意练习"）和吉姆-罗尔（Jim Loehr）（将运动心态应用于工作场所）。我们还研究了哲学、心理学、人类学、认知科学以及其他许多传统上各自为政的研究领域。

Since then, we’ve continued to explore topics related to getting the best out of yourself on the things you care about most. Our goal has been to write the truth—which means being rigorous, evidence-based, and nuanced—and to do so in an accessible way. None of that has changed. What has changed is the environment in which we are currently writing.  

从那时起，我们不断探索与在您最关心的事情上发挥最大潜能有关的话题。我们的目标是写出真相--这意味着严谨、基于证据、细致入微--并以一种通俗易懂的方式实现。这些都没有改变。改变的是我们目前的写作环境。

When our work began, the broad application of “performance” was somewhat novel. While the idea of _stress + rest = growth_ is literally as old as time, we provided language and tools for it, and that was a new phenomenon. We called it “the growth equation,” which later became the name for this blog and our entire enterprise. People started to take rest seriously and consider the importance of [routine, ritual](https://thegrowtheq.com/you-need-rituals-and-routines-now-more-than-ever/), community, and purpose. We wrote countless articles for countless publications. It was a fun and exciting time.  

当我们开始工作时，"绩效 "的广泛应用还有些新颖。虽然 "压力+休息=成长 "的理念由来已久，但我们为此提供了语言和工具，这是一个新现象。我们称其为 "成长方程"，这后来成为了本博客和我们整个企业的名称。人们开始认真对待休息，并考虑常规、仪式、社区和目的的重要性。我们为无数出版物撰写了无数文章。那是一段有趣而令人兴奋的时光。

Yet as the idea of performance penetrated the general lexicon, it got flattened and appropriated for all kinds of nonsense—stuff that couldn’t be further from _actual_ performance. As it so often does, a much needed correction transformed into a pendulum that swung too far.   

然而，随着 "表演 "这一概念深入人心，它也被平铺直叙地挪用于各种无稽之谈，与实际表演大相径庭。就像经常发生的那样，一个亟需纠正的问题变成了一个摆得过大的钟摆。

Let us be clear: we are not two old guys longing for the old days or complaining about competition. For starters, neither of us are even forty! We do everything we can to find and elevate new voices who are doing good work in our genre. These people are out there. We wish there were more of them. We are also not here only to grumble. We’ll come to solutions in a moment.  

让我们明确一点：我们不是两个缅怀过去或抱怨竞争的老家伙。首先，我们都还不到四十岁！我们竭尽所能，寻找并提升在我们这个领域有出色表现的新声音。这些人就在那里。我们希望有更多这样的人。我们也不是只在这里抱怨。稍后我们将讨论解决方案。

But first, we want to shine light on the problem: the countless bros and influencers who saw an opportunity to exploit increasing interest in performance. While we were realizing our initial treatment of the topic was, if anything, too narrow—hence our more recent books on [groundedness](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Groundedness-Transformative-Feeds-Not-Crushes-Your/dp/0593329899), [resilience](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Things-Resilience-Surprising-Toughness/dp/006309861X/ref=pd_bxgy_img_sccl_2/135-4067682-4544858?pd_rd_w=MsqPV&content-id=amzn1.sym.7746dde5-5539-43d2-b75f-28935d70f100&pf_rd_p=7746dde5-5539-43d2-b75f-28935d70f100&pf_rd_r=KHJ3M6GGTPCFHV29CQ9D&pd_rd_wg=DBGEY&pd_rd_r=d8817f68-98c3-422f-ad97-679cc708990c&pd_rd_i=006309861X&psc=1), and [rugged flexibility](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Change-Everything-Changing-Including/dp/006325316X)—a tidal wave of people on the internet began reducing performance to monetizable click bait and fuel for marketing.  

但首先，我们要揭示问题所在：无数的兄弟和有影响力的人看到了机会，他们利用了人们对性能日益增长的兴趣。当我们意识到我们最初对这一话题的处理过于狭隘时--因此我们最近出版了关于 "脚踏实地"、"韧性 "和 "坚韧的灵活性 "的书籍--互联网上如潮水般涌来的人们开始将 "表现 "贬低为可以赚钱的点击诱饵和营销燃料。

Enter: the optimization gurus; the diet gurus; the supplement gurus; the turning rest and recovery into a trackable job—which, by the way, is quite exhausting—gurus; the posting pictures of their six-packs gurus; the cold plunge gurus; the posting pictures of their six packs from their cold-plunges gurus; and on, and on, and on.  

进入：优化大师；节食大师；补充剂大师；把休息和恢复变成一项可追踪的工作--顺便说一句，这很累人--的大师；张贴他们六块腹肌照片的大师；冷水浴大师；张贴他们冷水浴后六块腹肌照片的大师；等等，等等，等等。

Essentially, people got very good at _marketing_ the work without any deep knowledge, expertise, or skin in the game on the _actual_ work. This led to the proliferation of social media mavens who are essentially human versions of the earliest chat-GPTs: they take solid work and plagiarize it, with no knowledge of what any of it means or the importance of context.   

从根本上说，人们擅长营销作品，却对实际作品没有任何深入的了解、专业知识或切身体会。这就导致了社交媒体达人的泛滥，他们基本上就是最早的聊天工具的人类版本：他们拿着可靠的作品进行剽窃，却不知道其中的含义或上下文的重要性。

Two unfortunate things happen as a result:  

结果发生了两件不幸的事情：

1.  The average person who is looking to improve in whatever it is they do gets caught up in this stuff, hopping from trend to trend and fad and fad without making any meaningful progress.  
    
    普通人无论做什么都希望有所进步，但却被这些东西所迷惑，从一个潮流跳到另一个潮流，从一个时尚跳到另一个时尚，却没有取得任何有意义的进步。
2.  People hear the word “performance” and cringe because it is now associated with all the kabuki above.  
    
    人们一听到 "表演 "这个词就会感到恐惧，因为它现在已经与上述所有歌舞伎联系在一起了。

It is important to note that we are not faulting you if you’ve fallen for this trend.需要注意的是，如果您已经上当受骗，我们并没有责怪您的意思。 It’s human nature; we are all susceptible.  

这是人类的天性，我们都很容易受到影响。 Complex-sounding, neatly packaged, and easy solutions to our problems seduce our prehistoric (and quite powerful) lizard brains.  

听起来复杂、包装整齐、简单易行的问题解决方案诱惑着我们史前的（相当强大的）蜥蜴大脑。

In the 5th century BC, Herodotus wrote of searching for the fountain of youth, the eternal wellspring of health. Over two thousand years later, in the 1500s, legend has it that Ponce de Leon—just picture this guy as your modern day longevity influencer—searched for it in Florida. Today, the fountain of youth resides in a wearable fitness tracker, an intermittent fasting routine, or a selfie from an $8000 bath tub full of freezing cold water.  

公元前 5 世纪，希罗多德写下了寻找青春之泉、永恒健康之泉的故事。两千多年后的 1500 年代，传说中的庞塞-德-莱昂（Ponce de Leon）在佛罗里达州寻找到了青春之泉。如今，可穿戴健身追踪器、间歇性断食疗法，或者在价值 8000 美元、装满冷水的浴缸里自拍，都是青春之泉的踪迹。

It’s only natural to  want an edge. No one wants to miss out on finding “the” secret. Yet almost all quests for the magic elixir have been rebuffed for over 2,500 years. Maybe it’s time we start doing what _actually_ works.  

想要获得优势是很自然的。谁也不想错过寻找 "秘密 "的机会。然而，2500 多年来，几乎所有对灵丹妙药的探索都遭到了拒绝。也许是时候开始做真正有效的事情了。

The basics aren’t sexy. They don’t sell. They aren’t a quick fix. They are simple to understand but difficult to practice consistently. It’s why so many people buy supplements to improve their strength, but so few squat two times a week for months, if not years, on end. It’s why so many people skim twitter threads and serially subscribe to short-form newsletters but don’t read anything over 300 words, let alone actual books.  

基础知识并不性感。它们不畅销。它们不是一蹴而就的。它们简单易懂，却难以持之以恒。这就是为什么那么多人购买保健品来提高力量，却很少有人每周深蹲两次，持续数月甚至数年。这也是为什么有那么多人浏览微博主题，连续订阅简短的时事通讯，却不阅读超过 300 字的内容，更不用说真正的书籍了。

At this point, we are often met with some version of _okay, if this is so simple, then why read your newsletter or books_, _why even read this post_? It’s a valid question. Our answer is because simple does not mean easy, and getting—let alone staying—on the path to more sustainable health, well-being, and performance requires loads of motivation, reinforcement, and, at times, hand-holding.  

在这个时候，我们经常会遇到这样的问题：好吧，如果这么简单，那为什么还要读你的通讯或书，甚至为什么还要读这篇文章？这是一个合理的问题。我们的回答是，简单并不意味着容易，要想获得--更不用说坚持--更可持续的健康、幸福和表现，需要大量的动力、强化，有时还需要手把手地教。

We are not trying to create something bright and shiny to sell you. We are trying to help you understand what it means to perform at your best – to get the best out of yourself on the things that matters to you most – in day to day life. What follows is a list of core principles, along with specific and evidence-based habits for your body and mind:  

我们并不是要创造一些光鲜亮丽的东西向你推销。我们只是想让你明白，在日常生活中，如何发挥自己的最佳状态，在对你最重要的事情上做到最好。以下是一系列核心原则，以及具体的、以证据为基础的身心习惯：

## **Principles 原则**

**Consistency over Intensity:** Anyone can crush themselves a few times a year and post it to social media. But the road to meaningful progress is paved with small steps that are aligned with your values. When taken regularly over time, these small steps compound for big gains.  

一致性胜于强度：任何人都可以在一年中碾压自己几次，并将其发布到社交媒体上。但是，通往有意义进步的道路是由与你的价值观一致的小步骤铺就的。只要长期坚持，这些小步骤就会带来大收获。

**Real Toughness over Fake Toughness:**  Out with the machismo acts of strength and power; in with knowing how to make the right decision in the moment when under distress. This is what real toughness is all about.  

真正的坚韧胜过虚假的坚韧：摒弃大男子主义的力量和权力行为；懂得在危难时刻做出正确的决定。这才是真正的坚韧。

**Rugged Flexibility over Rigidity:** Rigidity works well for short periods of time but ultimately leads to anxiety(焦虑) and burnout. Staying on the path of performance requires the ability to adapt and holding onto multiple ideas at the same time: grit and quit, self-discipline and self-compassion, tragedy and optimism, solitude and community, ruggedness and flexibility.  

坚韧的灵活性胜过僵硬：僵化在短时间内效果不错，但最终会导致焦虑和倦怠。在追求卓越的道路上，需要同时具备适应能力和坚持多种理念的能力：坚韧与放弃、自律与自怜、悲剧与乐观、孤独与集体、坚韧与灵活。

**Confidence over Arrogance:** Confidence is based on evidence. Arrogance is based on insecurity. Confidence is quiet. Arrogance is loud.  

自信胜于自大：自信基于证据。傲慢基于不安全感。自信是安静的。傲慢是响亮的。

**Depth over Shallowness:** Depth means dedication and joy in truly coming to know something. Shallow means optimizing for quantity, growth, and checking things off a list for the sake of checking things off a list.   

深度胜于浅薄：深入意味着在真正了解某件事情时的专注和喜悦。浅薄意味着追求数量和增长，为了完成任务而完成任务。

## **Practices: Body 实践：身体**

**Move Your Body Often, Sometimes Hard, Every Bit Counts.  

经常活动身体，有时要用力，每一点都很重要。**

If exercise could be bottled up and sold as a drug, it would be a billion-dollar blockbuster.如果能把运动装瓶后作为药物出售，那将是价值十亿美元的大片。 Decades of studies show that just 30 minutes of moderate to intense daily physical activity lowers your risk for physiological diseases, like heart disease and cancer, as well as psychological ones, like  

几十年的研究表明，每天只需进行 30 分钟的中强度体育锻炼，就能降低患心脏病和癌症等生理疾病的风险，以及患以下心理疾病的风险 [depression](https://thegrowtheq.com/everything-we-know-about-exercise-and-depression/) and [anxiety(焦虑)](https://thegrowtheq.com/lifting-weights-helps-ease-anxiety-and-depression/).  抑郁和焦虑

The problem is we overcomplicate exercise to death: we shift from zone-two to HIIT to whatever other buzzword bingo for exercise is going on.  

问题是，我们把运动过度复杂化了：我们从 "二区 "转向 "HIIT"，再转向其他任何流行的运动词汇。  

  

If you are training to make the Olympic trials or to maximize your performance in a specific sport, you will need to play with the details, but when it comes to如果你的训练是为了参加奥运选拔赛，或者是为了在某项运动中取得最佳成绩，那么你就需要在细节上下功夫，但当涉及到 [general health 一般健康](https://twitter.com/stevemagness/status/1463154117153419271) and performance, it’s quite simple: do consistent work, mostly easy, occasionally hard, and vary it up. Here are some details:  

和表现，其实很简单：坚持不懈地工作，大部分时间轻松，偶尔努力，并不断变化。下面是一些细节：

-   “Consistency is king”: Stacking weeks and months of training is what leads to gains, not heroic workouts. Find something enjoyable and do it for a long period of time.  
    
    "坚持才是王道"：将数周、数月的训练叠加在一起才能有所收获，而不是逞能式的训练。找到一些令人愉悦的事情，并长期坚持下去。
-   “Mostly easy”: For the majority of your exercise, you should be able to have a full conversation but where someone would know your exercising. For some this is a walk, for others a run. Be in this zone 4-5x per week, building up to  40+ minutes per effort.  
    
    "基本轻松"：在运动的大部分时间里，你应该能够进行完整的对话，但不能让别人知道你在运动。对有些人来说这是散步，对有些人来说这是跑步。每周在此区域锻炼 4-5 次，每次锻炼 40 分钟以上。
-   “Occasionally hard”: 1-2x per week do something that is moderately hard: think about a 7 or 8 out of 10.  
    
    "偶尔困难"：每周做 1-2 次难度适中的事情：考虑 10 分中的 7 分或 8 分。
-   “Vary it up”: Longer and moderate, short and intense, up a hill, part of a circuit, lifting heavy things. Cycle through different emphasis, and try not to leave anything completely behind.  
    
    "多变"：长而适度、短而激烈、上坡、循环练习的一部分、举重物。在不同的重点中循环，尽量不要完全落下什么。

**Be Wary of Diets. Focus on Quality.   

警惕饮食。注重质量。**

Let’s be honest, most diets are made to help someone else get rich. We often talk about big agriculture or big sugar, but big diet is the same.老实说，大多数饮食都是为了帮助别人致富。我们常说大农业或大糖业，但大饮食也是一样。 The global market for weight loss and diet products is nearly $300 billion.  

全球减肥和节食产品市场规模近 3000 亿美元。

All diets work…and don’t. Similar to the exercise wars, the best diet is a sustainable one that focuses on quality nutrient dense food in which your energy needs are met but not exceeded.  

所有的饮食都有效......也都无效。与 "运动大战 "类似，最好的饮食也是一种可持续的饮食，它以优质营养丰富的食物为主，能够满足你的能量需求，但不会超出你的需求。

Always be wary of more extreme diets, such as intermittent fasting—they can be [slippery slopes to eating disorders](https://thegrowtheq.com/broscience-is-not-real-science/)  

始终警惕间歇性禁食等更极端的饮食方式--它们可能会成为导致饮食失调的隐患, which are lethal.它们是致命的。 If you are going to go on a more extreme diet it ought to be done under medical supervision with a  

如果您要进行更极端的节食，应在医生的指导下进行，并由一名营养师负责。 [board certified obesity physician  

肥胖症认证医师](https://www.abom.org/). And, for those interested in longevity who are searching for a single diet or supplement, two interesting facts:  

.此外，对于那些对长寿感兴趣，但又想寻找单一饮食或补充剂的人来说，有两个有趣的事实：

1.  Studies of centenarians (people who live over 100) [show they have diverse diets](https://www.bluezones.com/recipes/food-guidelines/) with really only one thing in common: they hardly eat any processed foods and they move their bodies often. But none of these centenarians are tracking their ketones or blood sugar.   
    
    对百岁老人（寿命超过 100 岁的人）的研究表明，他们的饮食多种多样，但只有一个共同点：他们几乎不吃任何加工食品，而且经常活动身体。但是，这些百岁老人都没有跟踪他们的酮体或血糖。
2.  A study published in the [_Annals of Internal Medicine_](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/well/eat/supplements-and-diets-for-heart-health-show-limited-proof-of-benefit.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fwell&action=click&contentCollection=well&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=sectionfront) reviewed data from hundreds of clinical trials involving nearly a million people and found that 16 of the most popular supplements and eight of the most popular diets have virtually no benefit—and some even cause harm.  
    
    发表在《内科学年鉴》上的一项研究回顾了数百项临床试验的数据，涉及近一百万人，结果发现，16 种最流行的补充剂和 8 种最流行的饮食几乎没有任何益处，有些甚至会造成伤害。

A simple rule of thumb is to minimize ultra-processed foods.  

一个简单的经验法则是尽量减少超加工食品。

Foods that undergo heavy processing lose much of their nutritional value.  

经过大量加工的食物会失去很多营养价值。 The result is not-so-great energy combined with lots of calories and a lack of satiation. Over time, this is a recipe for ill health. But what about all the diets, you may be wondering? Research shows that whatever “diet” you choose,  

这样做的结果是，能量不是很充足，热量也很高，而且缺乏饱腹感。久而久之，就会导致健康状况不佳。但你可能想知道，所有的节食方法又是怎么回事呢？研究表明，无论你选择哪种 "饮食"，都会对健康造成不利影响、 [the only real indicator as to whether or not you’ll lose weight is if you stick to it.  

你是否能减肥的唯一真正指标就是你是否能坚持下去。](https://thegrowtheq.com/the-case-for-not-changing-a-thing-an-ode-to-patience/) That’s right. The so-called success of a diet has less to do with fat, carbs, or ketones than it does with one’s adherence, which basically disproves all the magic and single-nutrient theories that are the stuff of mega best selling diet books. Carbs are not bad. Fats are not bad. Proteins are not bad. They are all just nutrients.   

没错。所谓的节食成功与否，与脂肪、碳水化合物或酮的关系不大，而与一个人的坚持程度有关，这从根本上推翻了所有神奇的单一营养素理论，而这些理论正是超级畅销节食书籍的内容。碳水化合物不是坏东西。脂肪不是坏东西。蛋白质不是坏东西。它们都只是营养素而已。

**Sleep Seven to Nine Hours.  

睡七到九个小时**

It’s only after you’ve been sleeping for at least an hour that natural anabolic chemicals like testosterone and human growth hormone—both of which are critical to health and physical function—[are released](https://thegrowtheq.com/the-best-natural-performance-enhancing-drug/). What’s more, [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17520786) published in the journal _Sleep_ shows that with each additional 90-minute cycle of deep sleep, you receive even more of these hormones. In other words, there are increasing marginal benefits to sleep, and hours seven through nine—the hours most people don’t get—may actually be the most powerful.  

换句话说，睡眠的边际效益越来越大，而第七到第九小时，也就是大多数人没有睡的那几个小时，实际上可能是最有效的。 Deep sleep is also beneficial to mental health.  

深度睡眠还有益于心理健康。 It’s only during deep sleep when your brain combs through, consolidates, and stores all the information you came across during the day.   

只有在深度睡眠时，大脑才会梳理、整合并存储白天接触到的所有信息。  

只有在睡眠至少一个小时后，睾丸激素和人类生长激素等天然合成代谢化学物质才会释放出来，而这两种物质对健康和身体机能都至关重要。更重要的是，发表在《睡眠》杂志上的一项研究表明，每增加 90 分钟的深度睡眠周期，你就会获得更多的这些激素。

You may be thinking these are all great reasons to track your sleep, but proceed with caution. A new phenomenon that has coincided with the boom of sleep trackers and other wearables is [people developing anxiety(焦虑)](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/health/sleep-tracker-insomnia-orthosomnia.html) about their sleep duration and sleep quality, which, paradoxically, makes it harder for them to get sleep! [The two most general rules of sleep: try hard to get sleep, and don’t freak out too much if you can’t.](https://thegrowtheq.com/two-simple-rules-for-better-anything/)  

您可能会认为这些都是追踪睡眠的好理由，但请谨慎行事。随着睡眠追踪器和其他可穿戴设备的蓬勃发展，出现了一种新现象，即人们对自己的睡眠时间和睡眠质量产生了焦虑，这反而使他们更难入睡！睡眠有两条最普遍的规则：努力入睡，如果睡不着也不要过于焦虑。

The evidence-based counsel on sleep, in a nutshell, is as follows:  

关于睡眠的循证建议简而言之如下：

-   _Morning_**:** Go outside or open the blinds. Natural light triggers a cascade of hormones that help to maintain a balanced circadian rhythm, the body’s natural clock.  
    
    自然光会触发一连串的荷尔蒙，帮助维持平衡的昼夜节律，即人体的自然时钟。  
    
    早上好外出或打开百叶窗。
-   _Afternoon 下午_: If you need it, enjoy your last coffee of the day.:如果需要，请享用今天的最后一杯咖啡。 The effects of caffeine can last up to eight hours.  
    
    咖啡因的作用可持续长达 8 小时。
-   _Evening 晚上_: Eat dinner. :吃晚饭 While the timing here is very individual, a hyperactive digestive system can get in the way of falling asleep, so aim for at least two hours between your last meal and bedtime.  
    
    虽然时间是因人而异的，但亢奋的消化系统会妨碍入睡，因此应争取在最后一餐和就寝时间之间至少间隔两个小时。 Small snacks are okay. If you’re going to drink alcohol, limit yourself to one drink, as alcohol can interfere with deep sleep.  
    
    小点心也可以。如果要喝酒，请以一杯为限，因为酒精会影响深度睡眠。
-   _Dusk_**:** Turn off screens. Research shows that staring at blue light before bed makes it harder to fall asleep. Put work and the news away, as it can cause stress and set your mind racing.  
    
    黄昏：关闭屏幕。研究表明，睡前盯着蓝光会让人更难入睡。把工作和新闻放在一边，因为它们会给你带来压力，让你的大脑飞速运转。
-   _Nighttime_**:** Before hitting the sack, use curtains or blinds to make your bedroom as dark as possible, and lower the thermostat so your room is a little cooler than the rest of the house. Decreased body temperature is associated with deeper sleep.  
    
    体温降低与深度睡眠有关。  
    
    夜间：睡觉前，使用窗帘或百叶窗让卧室尽量变暗，调低恒温器，让房间比其他地方凉快一些。

**Don’t Smoke, And Seek Help Quitting If You Do.  

不要吸烟，如果吸烟，请寻求戒烟帮助。**

Smoking is [associated with dozens of types of cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco/cessation-fact-sheet)  

吸烟与数十种癌症有关, as well as heart disease, dementia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  

以及心脏病、痴呆症和慢性阻塞性肺病。 According to the American Cancer Association,  

据美国癌症协会称 [smoking causes one out of every five deaths  

每五例死亡中就有一例是由吸烟造成的](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/tobacco-and-cancer/health-risks-of-smoking-tobacco.html) in the United States, killing more people than alcohol, car accidents, HIV, guns, and illegal drugs combined.  

在美国，它造成的死亡人数比酒精、车祸、艾滋病、枪支和非法毒品造成的死亡人数总和还要多。 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, your body starts repairing the damage caused by smoking  

根据美国疾病控制和预防中心的研究，您的身体会开始修复吸烟造成的损伤 [within days of stopping 几天内停止](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2004/posters/20mins/index.htm).

**Don’t Drink (At Least Not Too Much).  

不要喝酒（至少不要喝太多）。**

Like smoking, excessive alcohol use is [associated with a number of chronic diseases](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arcr352/155-173.htm)  

与吸烟一样，过度饮酒也与多种慢性疾病有关, such as liver cirrhosis, throat cancer, and cardiovascular disease.  

如肝硬化、喉癌和心血管疾病。 Drinking too much also impairs sleep and daily function. If you enjoy alcohol,  

饮酒过量还会影响睡眠和日常功能。如果您喜欢喝酒 [drinking reasonably 适量饮酒](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/faqs.htm)—less than three drinks per week—seems to carry minimal risk when it comes to health. But for peak performance and acute readiness, when it comes to drinking, less is more. This doesn’t mean a single drink of bourbon with your friends will ruin your week (unless you are in recovery), so don’t obsess. But as a general rule, it’s good to err on the side of minimalism. For instance, Steve rarely drinks and Brad maybe has four to five drinks per month, always in social settings.  

\-每周饮酒少于三杯，似乎对健康的风险极小。但要想达到最佳状态和做好充分准备，喝酒还是少为妙。这并不意味着和朋友喝上一杯波旁酒就会毁掉你这一周的生活（除非你正在戒酒），所以不要纠结于此。但一般来说，最好还是尽量少喝。例如，史蒂夫很少喝酒，布拉德每个月可能喝四到五杯，而且都是在社交场合。

**Build Community. Surround Yourself Wisely.  

建设社区。明智地包围自己。**

The people with whom you surround yourself [shape you](https://thegrowtheq.com/good-vibes-are-contagious/). Yet here is the modern-day trap: our incessant drive to be productive, efficient, and optimizing always may help us to get ahead in the short run, but is detrimental to our well-being in the long run. It crowds out time and energy that we could devote to forging closer bonds to family and friends, and to experiences and traditions that give us a deeper sense of belonging. As the psychologist and philosopher Erich Fromm put it in his influential 1941 book, _Escape from Freedom_, “To feel completely alone and isolated leads to mental disintegration just as physical starvation leads to death.”  

你周围的人塑造了你。然而，现代人的陷阱就在这里：我们不断追求生产力、效率和最优化，这或许能在短期内帮助我们取得成功，但从长远来看，却有损于我们的福祉。它挤占了我们的时间和精力，而这些时间和精力本可以用来与家人和朋友建立更紧密的联系，用来体验和继承能给我们带来更深归属感的传统。正如心理学家兼哲学家埃里希-弗洛姆（Erich Fromm）在其 1941 年出版的极具影响力的著作《逃离自由》中所说："感到完全孤独和孤立会导致精神崩溃，就像身体饥饿会导致死亡一样"。

A large body of [research](https://thegrowtheq.com/you-can-be-happy-and-lonely-at-the-same-time/)  

大量研究 conducted by the late University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo shows that loneliness is associated with anxiety(焦虑), depression, burnout and feelings of being unmoored.  

芝加哥大学已故心理学家约翰-卡西奥波（John Cacioppo）的研究表明，孤独与焦虑、抑郁、倦怠和无归属感有关。 As Cacioppo emphasized, our species evolved in close-knit groups, and finding a place in a deep community is one of our abiding needs.   

正如卡西奥波所强调的，我们这个物种是在紧密团结的群体中进化而来的，在一个深厚的群体中找到一席之地是我们永恒的需求之一。

On our deathbeds we are likely to dwell not on that big promotion, glittering award, or other outward achievement but on the bonds we forged with other people along the way. Deep community provides us with spaces in which we can support each other through ups and downs. It’s where we find the relationships and ties that keep us [grounded](https://amzn.to/3F62xR8)  

在临终前，我们可能不会沉浸在升职、获奖或其他外在成就中，而是沉浸在一路走来与他人结下的情谊中。深厚的社区为我们提供了空间，让我们能够在跌宕起伏中相互支持。在这里，我们找到了让我们脚踏实地的关系和纽带.

## **Practices: Mind 实践：心灵**

**Don’t Expect Things to Feel Good all the Time.  

不要期望事情总是感觉良好。**

Conventional wisdom holds that motivation leads to action: The better you feel and the more energized you are, the more likely you are to take your desired step.  

传统智慧认为，有动力才会有行动：你感觉越好、越有活力，就越有可能迈出你想要的一步。 Though this  虽然这 _can 会_ certainly be true, what about when motivation dwindles or when you simply aren’t feeling motivated at all? In those instances, the best thing you can do to change your mental state is to change your physical state. Oftentimes, you don’t need to feel good to get going,  

这当然没错，但当你的动力减弱或根本没有动力的时候怎么办呢？在这种情况下，改变心理状态的最好办法就是改变身体状态。很多时候，你并不需要感觉良好才能开始工作、 [you need to get going to give yourself a chance at feeling good.  

你需要开始行动，给自己一个感觉良好的机会。](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Change-Everything-Changing-Including/dp/006325316X)

It’s not always easy, so sometimes you’ve got to _force_ yourself to take action. [Cognitive behavioral therapy](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610), which helps individuals through a range of mental health issues, including anxiety(焦虑) and depression, places an immense focus on the “behavior” part of the equation. That’s because it’s hard, if not impossible, to control your thoughts and the subsequent feelings they generate.  

这并不总是那么容易，所以有时你必须强迫自己采取行动。认知行为疗法可以帮助人们解决一系列心理健康问题，包括焦虑和抑郁，它非常注重等式中的 "行为 "部分。这是因为要控制自己的想法以及随之产生的感觉，即使不是不可能，也是很难的。

What you can control, however, is your behavior—that is, your actions.  

然而，你能控制的是你的行为，也就是你的行动。

Consider, for example, a period during which you find yourself in a rut. Your thoughts and feelings are pummeling you with some flavor of “you suck, you’re going to fail, it’s cold outside, stay in bed.” It’s really hard to think your way out of that jam. But if you accept your thoughts and feelings and simply take action anyways, then you give yourself the best chance of changing your thoughts and feelings! This is one reason exercise has been [proven so effective](https://thegrowtheq.com/everything-we-know-about-exercise-and-depression/) at diminishing or even reversing mild depression.  

举个例子，你会发现自己在一段时间内陷入了困境。你的想法和感觉都是 "你很差劲，你会失败，外面很冷，呆在床上"。要想摆脱这种困境真的很难。但是，如果你接受自己的想法和感受，并简单地采取任何行动，那么你就给了自己一个改变想法和感受的最好机会！这就是运动被证明能有效减轻甚至逆转轻度抑郁的原因之一。

**Seek Professional Help if You Need It.  

如果需要，寻求专业帮助。**

Self-help has its limits. If you are feeling completely overwhelmed by negative thoughts and emotions, or if you are thinking of harming yourself or someone else, get professional help. Finding help doesn’t mean you are weak—it means you’re strong.自助有其局限性。如果你被消极的想法和情绪完全淹没，或者你有伤害自己或他人的想法，请寻求专业人士的帮助。寻求帮助并不意味着你软弱，而是意味着你坚强。 If you feel like you need help right now, you can call the national suicide-prevention lifeline 24/7 by dialing 988.  

如果您觉得自己现在需要帮助，可以拨打 988 全天候全国预防自杀生命热线。 When you’re in the thick of it, mental illness seems everlasting and impossible to overcome, but it can, and often does, get better.  

当你身陷其中时，精神疾病似乎是永恒的，不可能被克服，但它可以，而且往往会好起来。 Professional help—therapy, medication, or some combination of the two—goes a long way.  

专业人士的帮助--治疗、药物或两者的结合--会起到很大作用。

**Do Real Things in The Real World.  

在真实世界里做真实的事**

Doing something that is hard and real—for example, weightlifting, running, gardening, sculpting, woodworking—humbles you. You have to earn the successes. And when you experience failures, you can’t just talk them away. When the barbell drops, it drops. When you want to run under three hours for the marathon but go 3:04, the result is right in your face. It is hard to get out of touch with the world—or to become full of yourself—when you are working hard on something that is concrete, and when your successes are earned and your failures cannot be rationalized by corporate mumbo jumbo or social media hot takes. Doing real things in the world provides gravity, both literally and figuratively.  

做一些艰苦而真实的事情--比如举重、跑步、园艺、雕刻、木工--会让你感到磕磕绊绊。你必须赢得成功。而当你经历失败时，也不能一味地逃避。杠铃掉了，它就掉了。当你想在三小时内跑完马拉松，却跑出了 3:04 的成绩，结果就摆在你面前。当你努力去做一些具体的事情时，当你的成功是实实在在的，当你的失败不能被公司的胡言乱语或社交媒体的热炒所合理化时，你就很难与世界脱节，也很难变得自以为是。在世界上做一些实实在在的事情，无论从字面上还是从形象上，都能提供引力。

Pursuing mastery, a kind of gradual progress where tangible results can be traced back to oneself, increases self-reliance and self-confidence. Decades of research in a field called self-determination theory demonstrates that mastery is a core input to mental health, overall well-being, and life satisfaction.  

追求 "掌握 "是一种循序渐进的过程，在这种过程中，有形的成果可以追溯到自身，从而增强自立和自信。自我决定理论（self-determination theory）领域数十年的研究表明，掌握是心理健康、整体幸福感和生活满意度的核心要素。

Doing real things also affords you the experience of living in a smaller and simpler world, if only for a few hours. Compared to the complex, frantic, frenetic, and interconnected digital environment that occupies so much of our lives these days, a squat workout, mountain-bike ride, or trail run are more concrete. In these pursuits, you are the main factor that determines the outcome, and whatever obstacles you face are directly in front of you. This is a lot closer to how our species evolved. It’s no wonder these sorts of activities, though often objectively harder than sitting at a desk, in many ways feel so much easier.  

做实事还能让你体验到生活在一个更小、更简单的世界里，哪怕只有几个小时。与如今占据我们生活大部分时间的复杂、疯狂、狂热和相互关联的数字环境相比，深蹲锻炼、骑山地自行车或越野跑更加具体。在这些运动中，你是决定结果的主要因素，你所面临的任何障碍都直接摆在你面前。这更接近我们人类的进化过程。难怪这些活动虽然客观上往往比坐在办公桌前辛苦，但在很多方面却让人感觉轻松得多。

**Read Books. 阅读书籍。**

Deep reading, or full engagement in a book, is an absolute joy. It is good for mind and spirit, and it is also a competitive advantage in today’s knowledge-based economy. Increasingly, people struggle to pay attention to just about anything, let alone a book. Yet deep reading confers many benefits above and beyond watching a YouTube video or skimming an article or summary.深度阅读，或者说全身心投入一本书的阅读，绝对是一种享受。它有益于心智和精神，也是当今知识经济时代的竞争优势。越来越多的人难以专注于任何事情，更不用说一本书了。然而，深度阅读所带来的诸多益处，远远超过观看 YouTube 视频或略读文章或摘要。 These benefits include developing a richer understanding of a topic, increasing your ability to pay attention itself, and enhanced creative thinking.  

这些益处包括加深对主题的理解，提高自身的注意力，以及增强创造性思维。

Here are six principles for developing a nonfiction deep reading habit. All are based on the latest [research](https://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393072223/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) and real-world practice. (Details on each principle are [here](https://thegrowtheq.com/a-brief-guide-to-developing-a-deep-reading-habit/).)  

以下是培养非虚构类深层阅读习惯的六项原则。所有原则都基于最新的研究和现实世界的实践。(有关每项原则的详细信息，请点击此处）。

1) Use a hardcopy book if possible.  

1) 尽可能使用硬拷贝书籍。

2) No digital devices in the room.  

2) 房间里不能有数码设备。

3) Read with a pen and a highlighter  

3) 用钢笔和荧光笔阅读

4) Keep a notebook nearby to unload distracting thoughts  

4) 在附近放一本笔记本，以排解杂念

5) Read for at least 30 minutes per sitting of intentional, deep reading.  

5)每次阅读至少 30 分钟，进行有意识的深度阅读。

6) Think of deep reading as a muscle: you’ve got to train it  

6) 将深度阅读视为肌肉：你必须训练它

**Work in Intervals. 间隔工作。**

Regardless of the task at hand, it seems that highly focused, single-task intervals allow you to exert and sustain the physical, cognitive, and emotional energy required to get the most out of what you’re doing. This intense, [deep-focus work](https://thegrowtheq.com/being-more-doing-better-and-the-case-for-less/) ought to be followed by [rest](https://thegrowtheq.com/how-to-actually-get-some-rest-for-once/). This ebb and flow—time on, time off—runs counter to the most common strategies we adopt to get through the workday: either perpetually working in an “in-between zone” of moderately hard work while constantly flitting back and forth between tasks, emails, and Slacks, or working at the utmost intensity nonstop. Neither of these more traditional approaches is ideal. The former leads to under performance, the latter to burnout. A far better way to get the most out of your time is to take a decades-old lesson from athletics and [work in intervals, alternating between blocks of hard, deep-focus work and brief periods of rest.](https://thegrowtheq.com/how-interval-training-can-help-you-with-time-management/)  

无论手头的任务是什么，高度集中、单一任务的间歇似乎都能让你发挥并维持所需的体力、认知力和情感能量，从而最大限度地完成任务。这种高强度、深层次的专注工作之后应该有休息。这种 "上一段时间，下一段时间 "的起伏与我们为度过工作日而采取的最常见策略背道而驰：要么永远处于适度努力工作的 "中间地带"，同时不断在任务、电子邮件和休闲裤之间来回穿梭；要么以最大强度不停地工作。这两种传统方法都不理想。前者会导致工作表现不佳，后者会让人倦怠。充分利用时间的更好方法是从体育运动中吸取几十年的经验，采用间歇工作法，交替进行高强度、全神贯注的工作和短暂的休息。

This finding has been replicated in studies examining employees in a [meat-processing plant](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140130121538?journalCode=terg20) (on average, 51 minutes on followed by 9 minutes off), [agricultural workers](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169814105001538) (75 minutes on followed by 15 minutes off), and [computer programmers](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169814196000315) (50 minutes on followed by 7 minutes off). Across these studies, researchers agree that the reason such work cycles are effective is the same reason why they work in sports: Intervals stave off both physical and mental fatigue, allowing people to work better for longer over the course of a day. This same strategy of on and off, stress and rest, can be applied over weeks, months, and even years.  

对肉类加工厂员工（平均工作 51 分钟，休息 9 分钟）、农业工人（工作 75 分钟，休息 15 分钟）和计算机程序员（工作 50 分钟，休息 7 分钟）的研究也证实了这一结论。在这些研究中，研究人员一致认为，这种工作周期之所以有效，与它们在体育运动中发挥作用的原因相同：间歇工作可以缓解身体和精神疲劳，使人们在一天中能更好地工作更长时间。这种 "开 "与 "关"、"压力 "与 "休息 "的策略同样适用于数周、数月甚至数年。

**Spend Time in Nature. 在大自然中度过美好时光**

People report that they feel significantly happier outdoors than they do indoors, yet we spend less than 5 percent of our waking hours in nature.人们报告说，户外活动比室内活动更能让他们感到快乐，但我们在大自然中度过的时间还不到醒着时间的 5%。 Such were the findings of a recent  

最近的一项 [study](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/49376/1/Mourato_Happiness_greater_natural_2013.pdf) published in the journal  

杂志上发表的研究报告_Global Environmental Change.  

全球环境变化。_ The great irony is that while we’re hardly experiencing nature, we need it more than ever.  

极具讽刺意味的是，当我们几乎没有体验过大自然时，我们却比以往任何时候都更需要大自然。

[Research 研究](https://thegrowtheq.com/the-original-all-natural-remedy-for-burnout-nature/) shows that time spent in nature helps with mood, focus, creativity, fulfillment, perspective, problem-solving, blood-pressure, and sleep.  

显示，在大自然中度过的时间有助于改善情绪、专注力、创造力、成就感、视野、解决问题的能力、血压和睡眠。 Aim for at least a few minutes every day, knowing that more is better. And when you have more time, perhaps on the weekends, there is nothing like a  

目标是每天至少几分钟，知道越多越好。当你有更多的时间时，也许是在周末，没有什么比一个 [day hike 日行](https://thegrowtheq.com/the-most-underrated-workout-hiking/) to regain perspective and reset your mood.  

以重拾视野，重塑心情。

**Diversify Your Sources of Meaning.  

丰富你的意义来源。**

Going all-in and being single minded looks good on social media. But in the real world, if your sport or job or presence on social media is the be-all-end-all of your life, you are making yourself fragile: because a single failure or poor season breaks you. You are better off if you diversify your sense of self and from where you derive meaning in life. It’s not to say the game, project, or whatever it is in which you are competing isn’t important. It’s just to say it’s not the _only_ thing that is important.  

全情投入、一心一意在社交媒体上看起来不错。但在现实世界中，如果你的运动、工作或在社交媒体上的存在就是你生活的全部，你就会让自己变得脆弱：因为一次失败或一个糟糕的赛季就会让你崩溃。如果你能将自我意识多样化，并从中获得生活的意义，那么你会过得更好。这并不是说你所参加的比赛、项目或任何东西不重要。只是说它不是唯一重要的东西。

## **So What? From Principles and Practices to Action:  

那又如何？从原则和实践到行动**

A coach knows that the player who shows up with newest shoes and an arm sleeve, or the most expensive energy drinks, or a wearable on each wrist, is perhaps not the most likely to put in the actual work. But it’s the monotonous, boring stuff that makes the difference  

教练知道，穿着最新的球鞋、戴着臂套、喝着最昂贵的能量饮料、手腕上戴着可穿戴设备的球员，也许并不是最有可能投入实际工作的人。但是，正是这些单调乏味的东西，让比赛变得与众不同.

The world’s best performers don’t mess with bullshit. We know this because we have the privilege of working with them. What they do is stack good, consistent, and solid work for months and years.  

世界上最优秀的表演者不会胡扯。我们知道这一点，因为我们有幸与他们共事。他们所做的，就是在数月乃至数年的时间里，将优秀、稳定和扎实的工作堆叠在一起。

Here at _The Growth Equation_—in our books, newsletter, and podcast—you’ll never find any of the crap. What you’ll find are resources to help you to stay on the path, to help you to do the simple but not easy stuff over and over and over again, to help you cultivate the motivation, community, and reassurance to keep pounding the stone.

在《成长的方程式》这里，在我们的书籍、时事通讯和播客中，你绝对找不到这些垃圾。你能找到的是帮助你坚持走下去的资源，帮助你一遍又一遍地做那些简单但不容易的事情，帮助你培养动力、社区和保证，让你继续敲打石头。让你用语言表达你感觉到的和感受到的但无法表达的东西。

That’s our promise to you.  

这是我们对您的承诺。
